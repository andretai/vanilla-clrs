I just decided, I would like to try myself in this this field as a screenwriter, and finally I came across a course from Paul Castro, a screenwriter of August Rush with Jonathan Rhys Meyers starring (who was my initial inspiration)!!! Of course, I enrolled without hesitation. \nMaybe a bit early for me as for a beginner, but Udemy offers a lifelong access, so I will definately return to the materials of the course  after I start writing.
