                "I have been playing car racing games since their early beginning on PC. I currently have a logitech G25 force feedback wheel to play with.\nI have played most of the Colin Mc Rae, Need for speed, Grid and Dirt2 games before. I also tried my hands at more simulation oriented games like GTR, GTR2, GP Legends...\nDirt2 came in as a nice and pleasant surprise. Dirt3 tops it off.\n\nAs I am sure many will detail everything about this game, I will limit myself to the most important points for me.\n\nPros:\n- Amazing graphics\n- Amazing physics\n- Challenging but entertaining races\n\nCons:\n- Gymkhana\n- Interface\n\nWhat went through the conceptors mind about gymkhana? Racing is not easy for most but gymkhana is really a pain in the neck.\nI saw the videos of Ken Block on Youtube and indeed he is really impressive. Am I even dreaming of doing the same? No!\nRacing require good racing skills to start but Gymkhana requires a perfect control of the vehicles and most of us will never achieve such level. So I find the attemps slightly pointless and extremely frustrating.\n\nNow, what about the interface? Simply put, it does not remotely compare with Dirt2's interface. It is messy, I had to search online to figure out where to find my best times. There are not enough info about the cars, the races, the sponsors... It leaves a lot to desire. A complete miss.\n\nConclusion:\nAs far as rallye racing. This game is the best out there today.\nIf you are one who needs crazy challenges, try the gymkhana and good luck!\nIn spite of my criticism, I definitely do not regreat this purchase.",

                "Who would have ever thought Michael Jackson would die in this era?  It doesn't seem real, he wasn't supposed 2 die.  This collection of hits is almost as good as buying all of his solo works.  I actually would rather have each individual album but I don't have time for all that and I already own hundreds of cds, so The Essential Michael Jackson makes the most sense, for content and consolidation reasons.  But I still would like the artwork and other tracks from the other cds but I just don't feel like buying them, so i just bought this.  I went to 5 different stores and they were all SOLD OUT.  I finally got the last copy but I had to pay $25.  I think alot of people are just buying this cd as a trinket, I actually want to LISTEN to the music, so stop buying it if you are just going to hold it in your hand and stare at it and drool over it.  As for the music, I don't like any of the Jackson 5 stuff, it sounds dated and all the songs are overplayed.  I like \"Ben\", in my oppinion, that's the only good song MJ did when he was really young. They left out \"Never can Say Goodbye\" which is about the only good Jackson 5 song, so that sucked.  All MJ's other hits are on here from ALL the albums.  The only other song I'm pissed about is \"Jam\".  I wish they would have included that song, but I don't want to have to go out and find a copy of \"Dangerous\" just for that song.  Life is complicated and the music industry always makes it complicated for music fans. I wasn't really impressed with the pics in the liner notes, they could have included better, unreleased pics of Michael.  I am a Michael Jackson fan even though I disconnected with him and his music during the child molestation stuff.  Now that he died, I can feel better about paying him tribute and listening to his music again.  After all, I did a lip sync of \"Bad\" in full costume in high school drama class.  MJ was a part of my life.  God Bless u Michael, this world loved u.  *One last note....\"Farewell My Summer Love\" should have been included on this cd, that song is probably impossilble to find.  I used to have it on 45.",

                "I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench \/ allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!",
                "The pre-made contracts and forms are a blessing in disguise.  They are certainly very useful to get you going and give you an idea of what you may need to have in an agreement on many issues, however, if it's something really serious I wouldn't blindly use the forms here but edit them very carefully or have a lawyer look at them for you.\n\nOne really good feature of this product are the fully sercheable books which is really nice to keyword something in and find as much information as you can.  You can google it too, however, you have to sort out a lot of useless information on Google, here, it's all organized and professional!\n\nAlso:  buying this instead of the books individually certainly saves you a bundle, so might as well get them like this, sercheable, than in print.",

                "I have been looking forward to receiving this set since I learned about and pre-ordered it back in August. I am a huge Zelda fan and always wanted to get my hands on the strategy guides, but never seemed to get around to buying them when they first released and, over time, they became very expensive. This works out great because we can get all of the Collector's Edition guides, plus one never released and only available in this set (Ocarina of Time) for a great price - each guide ends up being less than $20 each not including the packaging.\n\nAs other have said, the packaging is wonderful. The treasure chest box is better quality than I had anticipated and the gold, metal etched bookmark is gorgeous! The actual shipping packaging was great, as well - very well protected with lots of foam so it arrived in pristine shape.\n\nThe guides themselves are gorgeous! Great detail and amazing artwork. I also love how the paper edges are golden - it gives it a very classy look. I have yet to actually read through them, let alone use them, so I can't say how accurate and useful they are, but I am sure the do their job and then some. I was very concerned about the Skyward Sword guide because the reviews for the original version were absolutely terrible. Fortunately, however, I read that it has been updated to meet the quality of all of the other guides, so that was a huge sigh of relief.\n\nI do have a few gripes for this set, though. They are quite minor in the grand scheme of things, so it didn't kill it for me too much - they are just things I wish they would have included.\n\nFirst, I am very disappointed that no guides were made for the older Zelda games, i.e. Zelda I and II for NES, Link to the Past for SNES, LInk's Awakening for Gameboy, etc. I wouldn't even mind if they threw several games into one or two books to make it more efficient - it would just have been nice to have guides for every Zelda game in one set.\n\nSecond, I was disappointed they didn't leave an empty slot for A Link Between Worlds. They've had this planned for a while and have had to have known the game was coming out the same time as this, as well as the collector's edition guide. Not a huge deal, but again... would have been a nice consideration.\n\nThird (and this is just something I would have thought to be cool - not dinging this set at all for not doing it) it would have been INCREDIBLE if they had some sort of audio device inside that makes the chest opening music from say Ocarina of Time when you open it - similar to when you open a greeting card with pre-recorded messages. Perhaps someday I will figure out how to do it myself - until then I will have to just sing the tune myself :)\n\nFinally, I am sad that some of the bonus content that came with the guides when they were originally released weren't included. I will be honest, I don't know which guides came with what, but I have seen others complain about this, stating that Twilight Princess in particular came with a few goodies.\n\nOverall, I am very happy with this set. For Zelda fans, it is a must buy especially if you don't own many or any of these guides already. Thanks for reading!",

                "It's no secret that Michael Jackson was incredibly talented and gifted musician, the fact that he also had a passion for his art must have helped. This two discs collection covering the man's entire career from the time he was a little kid up to his later years as one of the most famous person on this planet. It serves as an example of how great his music was and how it's still amazing today. Few artists have had the impact that MJ had on the music industry, Michael revolutionized it, and in the 1980's Michael was fashion. MJ's certainly has an interesting musical career and The Essential Michael Jackson is all the proof you need, we could go into how Thriller is the best selling album of all time, or how History is the best selling double disc album of all time, or how Blood On The Dance Floor is the best selling remix album... However the point here is not to demonstrate Michael's numerous accomplishments in the music industry, it's how good his music was.\n\nThe first 8 songs of this greatest hits album are from Michael's time in the Jackson 5\/ Jacksons. Then we get 4 songs from Off The Wall (1979), 7 songs from Thriller (1982), 8 from Bad (1987), 7 from Dangerous (1992) and 1 from both History (1995) and Invincible (2001). All the hits you would expect are here: Don't Stop `Till You Get Enough, Billie Jean, Thriller, Bad and much more. There isn't much to say about the songs included, they're all great in their own way and deserving to be on this \"essential\" collection. Besides the \"Ultimate Collection\" boxed set, this compilation is by far the most comprehensive look at Michael's career. It covers not only his solo career but his early years as a child with the Jackson 5\/ Jacksons which is a nice feature of this compilation disc, Michael Jackson compilations tend to be focused only on his solo career.\n\nI can't hide the fact that I'm a little disappointed that there is only one song from both History and Invincible. Those latter years album were not huge hits for Michael (although History sold very well and went on to become the most successful double disc album of all time) but I still like them both and thought more songs from these albums could\/should have been included. \"They Don't Care About Us\" and \"Earth Song\" are excellent songs from History that would have been excellent to have on a career-spawning collection. From Invincible I think \"Whatever Happens\" should have been here and perhaps \"Butterflies\". It's easy to understand why almost nothing from these albums was included, they do not really match the pop \"hits\" in terms of lyrics or musicality, they are much more personal and less accessible than material from Thriller or Bad for instance. That aside, The Essential Michael Jackson gives buyers what they really want, the hits and more well-known songs. I must add it does a good job at doing so!\n\nThe Essential Michael Jackson does an excellent job of going further than your average compilation and offers Michael's hits and some of his best songs. The fact that it covers his entire career is great; you get a proper overview of Jackson's music. For someone who is relatively new to Michael Jackson's music this is really The Essential Michael Jackson.  4  \/5.",

Please explain why the warranty is not valid in this case.  I don't see anywhere in the warranty exclusions that the warranty is not valid if not purchased from an authorized dealer.  In addition, a consumer would never know who \"authorized dealers\" are because if a company is selling your product doesn't that implicitly make them authorized to do so?\n\nI sincerely hope that NewAir will reconsider this position and stand by the integrity of their products.  This ice machine was literally used for four hours before failing and it is, quite frankly egregious that your company is negating a warranty that explicitly states it will repair or replace defective materials or workmanship for up to one year.\n\nPlease let me know how I can talk to a dispute department regarding this matter.

                "The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.",

                "In recent memory, strategy guides have become less of a necessity and more of a collector's item.  For every game nowadays there is a guide to accompany it.  Sometimes there's a collector's edition guide as well.  For collector's these are sometimes a lot of fun.  For Zelda fans that enjoy Zelda lore this collection is a fantastic buy.  There is a limited number in print and it's simply amazing to behold.  It's great packaging and actually has things in there specifically for collectors.\n\nBefore I begin I want to stress that this review won't be going into the content of each guide.  With the exception of the Skyward Sword guide, each of these guides is exactly the same as their standard (and separately released) collector's edition counterpart.  The reason Skyward Sword is not the same is because this copy was revised and expanded upon.  Aside from that, the other five guides are largely unchanged from their original releases.  There are subtle differences but nothing that greatly changes the actual content in the guide.\n\nTo begin, the guides come packaged in a box that looks like a chest.  When you open it up there are six hardbound guides in there.  The covers all look very similar.  Each one having an embossed Hyrule symbol on them.  The covers and the borders are different on each guide.  The six guides included are for Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, Ocarina of Time 3D, Skyward Sword and the Windwaker HD.  All the guides have gold leaf pages that are shiny when looking at them from the side.\n\nThere are a couple of things to note about the guides themselves.  The first is that it seems just a little strange that the guides themselves are not actually individually shrink wrapped.  This seems a little odd.  It's not that big of a deal but when you open the packaging they're already loose.  Considering each original release came shrink wrapped it's a little strange.  Perhaps the thing that some consumers might mind is that none of these guides come with their respective extras.  Anything that was considered a bonus for getting the collector's edition guide isn't here.  Likewise, when this particular collection was announced, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds simply wasn't planned for the package.  So anyone hoping this guide comes with the collection are out of luck.  That's no big deal.\n\nThere are also a couple of things to note here about only a couple of guides.  The first and most obvious is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  Prima NEVER actually released a hardcover edition of this guide.  Ever.  This is the first time that Ocarina of Time 3D players will get to grab this guide in hardcover.  Originally the guide was only in paperback.  This makes the collector's value certainly worthwhile as it means that the guide will have much more limited hardcover run than all the other guides here.  This boxset is more or less your only chance to get it.\n\nThe second thing of note is that the Skyward Sword guide included here is NOT the same as the one originally published.  It has been revised and expanded.  Even the layout is very different from the original guide itself.  It has been revised and expanded by over 100 pages.  It is almost a completely new guide from the original one that was released.  So yes, this one too is a rarity because you won't have much luck finding it outside of this particular box set.\n\nThere are a couple of subtle differences between some guides and the originals.  Most notably is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  The original guide was around 224 pages and written in three columns.  Here it's 288 pages and is written in two columns.  It's a lot easier to read and a lot cleaner as a result.  Much of the text isn't so cramped.  Some moments in the Ocarina of Time 3D guide pop out a lot easier.  It just looks better and more organized overall.  The Legendary Checklist in the Ocarina of Time Guide is also better looking.  The tables are easier to read and easier on the eyes.  Likewise, the Legendary Checklist in the Twilight Princess Guide is A LOT easier to read and A LOT less cramped.  In the original guide the entire checklist was on a single page with just the location.  Here it's expanded to be in a table format, the font is bigger and it now lets you know your first chance to complete it as well as telling you what's required.  The Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks guides are virtually unchanged from their initial releases.  The Windwaker HD is pretty much the same as well.  So for those wondering about whether or not they've changed some things from the original guides, the answer is yes.  Quite simply put some of them are a tad easier to read.\n\nThe set also came with a few bonuses of note.  The first and probably most valuable of all, is that you get a certificate of authentication from Eijo Aonuma that is signed and numbered.  The second is a laser etched metallic bookmark.  For collectors this package is a pretty sweet deal.  It's invaluable.  The only thing I wish we could've gotten would have been to actually get all the extras the guides themselves actually came with.  It is more or less the only thing I feel is missing and keeping it from being a complete package.  Part of what made the guides collector's editions aside from the hardcovers was actually getting little bonuses that didn't come with the guide otherwise.\n\nNevertheless, for the fan of Zelda this is a good buy.  But let's be clear.  If you are buying this, chances are it is probably not to actually utilize the guides themselves.  After all, many of the games these guides are for have been out for a while and, truthfully, you could just buy them on their own if you really wanted them for strategy.  They are a collector's item.  And it is certainly a nice one.",
                "Amazing value. I cannot believe this set is available for this price. Everything from the packaging to the quality of the paper is stellar.  This set feels like it was put together with care in mind. Also worth noting is the fact that the Ocarina of Time guide can only be found in this set. Only criticism I have is that the cloth maps were not included for  Twilight Princess and Wind Waker. Still, Im very happy with my purchase.",

                "Innovation is a good thing when the point of innovation is to improve one's products and to enhance the experience of ones customers. But innovation as a way of creating a false impression of progress to mask a need to perpetually carve out market share is vile, and it has long driven Microsoft's business plan and service model. But two other marks of Microsoft has been its attempt corner a portion of the market, give the consumer no real alternative, and then force them to pay through the nose, meanwhile making it harder and harder to use previously purchased versions of the product. And to complete my portrait of the Microsoft that I hated to like, Microsoft had an absolutely dreadful customer service department. Not that Customer Service was inept, but merely unavailable. And turning the old department store adage on its head, not only was the customer never right, they were most likely very much wrong.\n\nAs a result, Microsoft had over time created a way of doing business that was out of touch with the needs of the customer. Indeed, I had come to dislike Microsoft so much that I stuck with my old copy of Office 2000 for years longer thatn I had any desire to. But I was not going to pay an absurd amount of money for a piece of software that they were only going to allow me to put onto one device, and that was not going to be supported by technical support.\n\nSo imagine my shock when I found myself something of a fan of their new way of doing business. Instead of being prohibitively expensive, Office 365 is reasonably priced. You pay less than $80 for a key to unlock a download on up to five devices. Or if $80 is too pricey, you can pay just under ten dollars a month for the same five-device key. And unlike in the past, when you paid a large amount of money for a single-user key to Office Lite (the Student Edition was essentially Word and Excel, while the subscription grants you the use of more Office programs, including Outlook, PowerPoint, Access, Publisher, and One Note. What was once a prohibitively expensive suite of programs suddenly became very reasonably priced (no doubt in part because pirated editions meant that instead of paying an absurd amount of money to Microsoft, people would simply go to a Torrent site and get a free copy of Office).\n\nAnd to make everything even more impressive, Microsoft's customer service is more accessible than ever. I had a particularly difficult installation due to preinstalled trial editions of Office 365 on my new computers. Microsoft worked with me at length to make sure Office 365 installed properly on all of my devices. Not just that, but when I expressed the wish to use my Hotmail e-mail address on Outlook, they escalated the problem to a higher level tech support person.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean that this is a perfect product. I have not liked the direction that Office has taken since Office 2007. And Microsoft still fails to include a crackerjack WYSIWYG HTML editor. But all in all I'm impressed with the nontechnical aspects of Office 365. And I have to admit that it is kind of fun having at least portions of Office installed on my desktop, my lap top, my smart phone, and my tablet. In a family with multiple computer owners, it should be possible for each family member to have a full version of Office installed on their computer. I'm still not a huge fan of Microsoft, but I'm delighted to see them make their products more consumer-friendly.",

                "Here's the review I also have posted on my blog, Polymer Clay Review [...]\n\nYes, another 5-star book. Are there books I don't like as much? Yes. Have those been published lately? No.\n\nIt has been a decade-yes, a decade-since Donna published her first book, The Art of Polymer Clay. This second book takes us to Donna today. Her style is elegant, her techniques are innovative, and her instruction makes her projects accessible. I've taken two classes from Donna. In fact, I joined my local clay guild when I first started claying just to take Donna's class-and I haven't looked back.\n\nDonna's book is like a portable Kato class. Donna taught many of these techniques in the classes I took from her. However, having this indispensable reference book enables me to review the class at my leisure and further experiment with her techniques. She approaches each technique in a straightforward manner-teach techniques, then apply them to a project. This enables us not only to complete a sample that masters the technique, but also a very beautiful finished piece that will get people talking.\n\nDonna splits the book into seven different sections:\n\n  * Polymer Clay Basics\n  * Mica Shift Techniques\n  * Transferring Images Onto Polymer Clay\n  * Creating Texture\n  * Paints, Inks and Pigment Powders\n  * Special Effects with Liquid Polymer Clays\n  * Sculpture and Mold Making\n\nI love Donna's techniques. They are the result of hours of experimentation and development on her part. The book details both how to do something-and why. For instance, Donna makes a mold from her rubber stamps using polymer clay and THEN uses that mold to create her pieces. She goes into detail about why she does this, and what the results are molding directly from a stamp versus taking an impression from a polymer clay mold made from a rubber stamp. It's something I never considered, but it makes great sense.\n\nThe twelve beautiful projects are accompanied by step-by-step instructions and photographs that walk you through each major component. While some projects are simple, others teach you techniques in constructing complex pieces like her coveted Japanese Inro boxes.\n\nPeppered throughout the book are awe-inspiring inspirational pieces, including the pieces submitted for two of Kato Polyclay's artists contests\/exhibitions-one focused on shoes (Feat of Clay) and one focused on boxes. I was honored to be the 2nd-place winner in the box contest, and my \"Donnelly's Sampler\" is included in the book.\n\nThis is yet another book that will stay in my permanent library. I love having a Donna class on my shelf, ready for me at any time.",

                "The demo is done with the PC version, with references to the Mac version when needed. The video is closed-captioned. You can set bookmarks. There are self-tests for each chapter as well.\n\nStarts off with \"what is HTML\" and some other basic stuff. Includes topics such as: Planning your Website; Defining a site in DW; Creating a new web page; Adding Text; Formatting with CSS; Images and rich media; Links; Page layout w\/ CSS; Tables; Forms; Reusable Content; Testing; etc. Each section has sub-sections with their own video, and some have sub-sub-sections to flesh out the material, such as the one regarding project management, or CSS, which includes discussion of CSS for print. It is not, however, a tutorial on \"the best way to lay out a site using CSS\" or anything like that. For that, you'll need a book or two on that subject.\n\nShe has a site that has some helpful resources, e.g. checklists for project management and site development, and helpful URLs. All in all, it's a decent introduction to creating web sites.\n\nShe sounds weird, though, like a robot (or Stephen Hawking's voicebox) with her halting, clipped delivery. She tends to be slightly chatty and repeat material, but it's not that bad; could be helpful for retention for people new to the subject.\n\nUI - at the top of the interface, there's a \"Previous Video\" button and \"Next Video\" button. The \"Next Video\" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you'll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read \"Take Test\" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists\/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.\n\nThere's a \"Watch and Work\" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you'll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.\n\nAll in all, a good value if you want to learn DreamWeaver.",

I had no problem attaching it to the neck of the guitar - the instructions were a little confusing at first, but once I played with it a bit,  I was able to figure it out.  I will say it is fun to be able to play chords at the start and helps familiarize the absolute beginner (me) with how the chords work.  I can't yet speak to how well the device helps you progress with learning the chords - it is a novel concept: you gradually remove the \"keys\" and finger the chords yourself, ultimately removing the device entirely once you've mastered the chords. I agree that it takes a bit of the frustration of learning, because you are playing chords right away, and I think that helps make learning fun.\nReally, my only complaint is that it's a bit expensive. The jury is still out as to whether it's worth the price or not.",

                "I'm a fairly experienced knitter of the one-color or color block intarsia vein, rather than a Fair Isle maestro, and what I loved best about this stitch guide is the multitude of reversible stitch patterns offered and shown reverse and obverse. If you knit and love to accumulate guides, stitch dictionaries, pattern books and design-your-own project books, this is a great resource. I find I'm always adapting knitting patterns slightly or significantly to swap out cables, add interesting borders so I can knit edges and body at the same time, what have you.\n\nThis gives you enough classic stitches to satisfy but its strength is in fresh twists on the usual or entirely new (at least to me) options in textured, lace, cables&cross stitches, slip st., and novelties. As others note, the stitches are arranged from simplest to most challenging in each section-- also a great help when deciding how much sweat and tears I'm wiling to expend.\n\nThis also does not frustrate me in the ways too many other books and guides do.\nHere, Leapman uses the symbols common in knitting magazines and most books on knitting you've seen. Yay!\nOne of my peeves with some designers and guidebooks is the use of their own symbology for charting various stitches. Alice Starmore leaps to mind as a woman living in her own private Idaho filled with her own Runic symbols. I have to translate her every chart's cable squiggles into the symbols I'm more familiar with just to get the thing going. Gorgeous end results, but geez.\n\nThis is concise but full of options, so I FIND something nifty quickly and easily.\nWhile I do love browsing Barbara Walker's stitch books, sometimes I'm just looking for a simple option and don't want to spend all day combing through umpteen volumes, each of which has its own section for lace, k\/p, cables, slip st.s, panels, etc. I wish Walker would compile all her lace, all cables, all k\/p, all color work, all panels, etc into huge sections in just ONE encyclopedia.\n\nUntil that happens, this is my new go-to for fast, interesting ideas to enhance my knitting.\n\nThis is not a great resource for traditional knitting stitch patterns, such as gansey (guernsey), it's perhaps best for 'modern' classic knitting.",

Not quite sure how many women that have been attracted to me because of Aqua Velva,  I do know for sure that it's just to many to count. Ha.  Not sure how long this has been around but the Williams Company ran a paper advertisement, taken from a 1949 magazine, which features Ralph Bellamy of Detective Story and Ezio Pinza of South Pacific for Aqua Velva After Shave Lotion. I'm sure you all remember Ralph Bellamy and Ezio Pinza from the 40's right.\n\nThere slogan was \" There is nothing like an AQUA VELVA MAN \" and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when I was a young man. It's just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.\n\nThe only negative about Aqua Velva is it does not last very long. Usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated. The more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have Ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.\n\nAt any rate this is a great classic after shave with a wonderful refreshing odor, give it a try you might just like it.\n\nNote :::; Some reviewers mention this 7oz size now comes in a plastic container, I just bought one in Wal-Mart and it was glass.",

                "This is a great package for beginners. I never played a ukelele before but I learned to play guitar many years ago.  I have no idea on how to tune a ukelele so I downloaded an app called \"Easy Ukelele\" available in Amazon and Google Playstore for free.  That is the only ukelele tuner I can recommend for beginners as it actually listens to your Ukelele and tells you when your device is in tune. I purchase this as gift to my son's 5th birthday that is coming up in 2 weeks so I have not yet preview the DVD and CD that came with it. I did however, checked and played with the ukelele while my son is at school, sleeping or playing outside to make sure that it is properly working when he open the box on his birthday and before the return period runs out.\n\nMy Review:\n\n1. The Package: The box comes with the Ukelele, Beginners Manual, DVD, CD, carry pack, and 2 extra set of Ukelele strings. Tuner is not included so I advise that you either buy a tuner or download the \"Easy Ukelele\" app I mentioned above.\n\n2. The Ukelele:  The Ukelele looks and feels decent. It has a sticker that says made in china. It comes pre-strung but it is out of tune.  I tuned it using the app I downloaded but it would not hold a tune. It is very bad that the sting gets out of tune before you even finish tuning all the other strings.  Basically, the ukelele sounded like an out of tuned toy when you first take it out of the box and even after a few adjustments.  Since the string is nylon, I gave it a chance to settle. I would tune it really sharp and leave it alone for at least 10 minutes or more then pick it up and strum on it and push the string from side to side.  I actually position the tuner pegs horizontally so I can see if it is moving when the string gets more tension. The tuner pegs stays in place so I know that the problem is with the string.  It could be that the string included is a cheap one.  After doing this a few time on day 1, I was able to play my first song I grabbed from the book (Clementine).  But after 1 song, you have to tune it again.  I just repeat what I did for the next 2 days, tuning it sharp and leaving it alone and play songs. Yesterday morning I tuned it sharp before leaving to work and when I came back in the afternoon, I checked the strings and they are still tuned to the same key I left them in the morning. I played with it for at least 10 minutes just trying to learn the music from the book and I was able to play at least 4 songs without any problem.  This morning, I checked the note again and they stay close to the G-C-E-A range. I could see this improving more as the ukelele gets used more. Even if I have to tune it every day  I would not have any problem with it.\n\nSo, for the reviews complaining about the device being out of tuned, just give the string a try to settle. This are cheap string that they included here and it will take time to settle in. Or you can buy a better quality string that costs around $9.00 for a set.  Another place you can check is the tuner, make sure that it does not get pulled back when the strings tension. If it would not hold its place then just grab a philips screw driver and tighten it a little.  That is an easy fix.\n\n2. The String: As I mentioned above, it is a cheap string that needs a lot of adjusting until it settles. Even if you buy a  good quality strings, I am sure that it will also need a few adjustment in the beginning. It comes with 2 extra set in case you accidentally snap the one that is already installed. The problem is that the extra set does not have a label so you have to eyeball it.  From some research I found online they said that the Thinnest string will be the A string. The second thinnest is the E string, The thickest is the C string and the second thickest is the G string. The extra string package says \"Gangia Brand\" on it so I assumed that that is the brand of the string.\n\n3. The Book: I just scanned the book and I could tell that it is written well for beginners. The songs included progress from only needing 2 chords in the beginning and they add more chords on the succeeding lessons. Each song have a chart on which chord you will use.\n\n4. The Case:  The case will protect your ukelele from dust, water and from getting dirty while you are transporting it but will definitely protect the device from being damage in case of a drop.\n\n5. The DVD's and CD's: I have not tried the DVD and CD's yet but the DVD's I believe will have the lesson and the CD will have the songs on the books so you can listen to it and have an idea on how to play the songs on the book. I will come back and edit this item once I get the chance to watch the DVD and listen to the CD.\n\nOverall. This is a great price for the package."

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle\/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask\/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.",

                "In 2005, Sony released without much or any fanfare the terrific \"Essential Michael Jackson\", which easily is the best Michael Jackson compilation available these days. It also released a slightly different international version, which I recently picked up while in China. No, I didn't buy it from a pirated-CD hawking character on some street corner. In fact I bought it in a regular CD store in Shanghai, for all of 39 RMB (about US$ 5.50), if you can believe that.\n\nThe international version of \"The Essential Michael Jackson\" (2 CDs, 38 tracks, 156 min.) differs only slightly from the US version:\n\n1. The Jacksons' \"Can You Feel It\" replaces \"Enjoy Yourself\" (an improvement);\n2. Somehow \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" (from \"Bad\") is lumped along with (and in the middle of) the \"Thriller\" songs on CD1, obviously not an improvement;\n3. The title track from \"Dangerous\" is left off, and instead 2 tracks from 1995's \"HIStory\" second CD of new material are added (\"Earth Song\" and \"They Don't Care About Us\"), a wash as far as I'm concerned although \"Earth Song\" remains a greatly underappreciated tune. How \"They Don't Care About Us\" ended up on the \"essential\" list, is a head-scratcher (although I like the song).\n\nWould I have bought this again if it wasn't for the ridiculous low price in China? Almost certainly not. But I am glad I did, if nothing else, because it is just another memento from my trip to China (the Chinese version comes with Mandarin characters on the cover). That aside, \"The Essential Michael Jackson\" is a terrific album, whether you buy the US version or the international version, and it really showcases Michael Jackson at his best.",

                "I am not a Biblical scholar whatsoever not have I ever played one on TV.  I enjoy reading the Bible for its historical information and have found over the years many different iterations of the Bible.  GLO, however, is the best collection of information not only pertaining directly to the written words contained in the King James Version and for many others.  There is nothing quite as pleasant as sitting in front of a monitor and just going from verse to verse but having those verses explained in a way the layman can fully understand some of the background.  For comparison I have a 1810 version of The King James Bible that has been passed down from several generations and is quite used.  The words, however, come through and are the same.  The annotations for each page, where applicable, are similar to GLO's annotations except the time in years actually makes a difference.  That's a good thing and GLO does it well.  I was not prepared for the full range of information contained in the program and even though it slows the speed of my computer it is well worth the small wait.  There are hundreds of meaningful pictures coupled with historical facts and comparisons.  I have found that reading the Bible is significantly rewarding and far better than listening to it on a recording.  Additionally, GLO sends its audience updates for contents and historical facts.",

                "Before reading on, please note that the newer, updated version (2012) is now available for less --&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Quicken-Legal-Business-Pro-2012\/dp\/B005CELLZM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Quicken Legal Business Pro 2012<\/a>. (Today, the price is just $26 for the updated version)\n\nThat said, I have not looked at the 2012 version, but it claims to have everything the old version has plus more. So I'll go ahead and comment on the old version we've used:\n\nFirst, most (probably all) of these forms can be found online for free. The real estate & leasing contracts, for example, can be found on your state realtors web site, or your state's bar association web site. Contracts for goods & services can be found on your state web site (department of motor vehicles for a bill of sale for a car, etc). But if you're like me and don't have time to browse, surf & download, here they are offered on one disc for a pretty reasonable price.\n\nI will also add, most of these forms are what you see on Nolo.com, usually on sale for $15-$20 each. So if you've ever downloaded a form or contract from Nolo, you can get a couple hundred forms here for the price of 2. They claim this contains $900 worth of forms (real estate & leases, bill of sale, service contract & invoicing, paperwork for hiring employees, corporate minutes, IRS tax forms, sample forms for corporate policies, and a few more).\n\nAll of that said, this is nowhere near exhaustive - if you are run a fairly straightforward service or contracting business, or are a sole proprietor, this might meet many of your needs. But if you have a corporation (even an LLC), this software is insufficient.\n\nI don't really agree with the reviewers who say this will save you legal fees - I don't know anyone who hires a lawyer to write such simple forms. There is nothing here that saved us any legal fees.\n\nAlso, none of the forms were usable \"as-is\" for me. Fortunately they can be customized, but I ended up adding huge addendums to any form I used. And, most of these forms are very common, we already had form letters on the computer for most of these topics (we store form letters online for free on our Google Docs account - saves file space, never worry about a crashed hard drive, and any employee can access & download a blank form from anywhere in the world, for free).\n\nNonetheless I still give this 3.5 to 4 stars. For me, it's all about saving time. There were a few useful things on here, which saved me an hour or two, so it's not perfect but it deserves a decent rating.",

(Plus you have to refill said gauge by disabling or killing enemies to be able to use it once it runs out). The visuals are vastly improved from Blood Money of course, and I appreciate their allowing me to play with my gamepad.\n\nSome have criticized the fact that this game has \"too much story\" in it.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle\/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask\/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.",

Sony made a smart move to release this after Michael Jackson was declared innocent.  This one, like the box set, combines his Jackson 5 hits, his Jacksons hits and his solo hits going up to 2001.  Past albums stopped at Thriller, but this goes even further to Invincible.  But my favorites are on here, from Got To Be There, I Want You Back, Shake Your Body, Blame It On The Boogie, Off The Wall, Beat It, Billie Jean, In The Closet, Remember The Time, Another Part Of Me, Bad, Dirty Diana(the hummable song), Smooth Criminal, Dangerous, and You Rock My World. The sound's a little loud, but I think they wanted a full, complete listening experience to the listener.  The packaging said 37 songs, but there are 38 songs here, and what a spectacular collection of Michael's hits. I know there are people saying, \"But why isn't Butterflies or State Of Shock on here?\"  It must have been tough deciding what to put on here, because Michael has always made quality music.  To Usher, Justin Timberlake, Omarion and the top singers\/dancers, you are all great artists, but you need 20 more years or so in the business to catch up to the greatness and artistry of Michael Jackson! Keep working at it! I could play these CDs all night long because all my favorites are on here! Can you hear those funky beats and rhythms in the distance when you hear this album going down an interstate for 100-170 miles or so on a road trip?  This is yet another great compilation album of Michael's hits, probably better than 2003's Number Ones. Get multiple copies to send to your family members and friends!"

After an hour a small spray on my arm had almost completely dissipated -- little scent remained.\n\nTo create this gender-free scent, ingredients typically used in male fragrances are combined with components typically used in female fragrances.

                "Since Amazon has lumped the Elektra CD release of this album i must specify which release i am reviewing. I am reviewing the 2000 24 karat Gold CD edition of Ride the Lightening remastered by Steve Hoffman. This is a Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab release just so people know. I own a few of their Miles Davis LP's remasters which sound amazing. Now back on track i have owned and played the hell out of Ride the Lightening (1995) CD put out by Elektra. While that version sounds good the 2000 Hoffman remaster blows any other CD edition out of the water. The album just has more life organic sound and does not sound harsh or filtered. The source material Mr. Hoffman worked on this release with was the original master tapes of the album. While the 1995 CD edition of RTL does not sound much different from the original vinyl version it did go through digital filtering possibly noise reduction and a few other things.  My reason for buying this version was i had heard Metallica had remastered Ride the Lightening again and were releasing a box set for the album. After hearing the sound on the album in that box had fallen victim to the loudness war i searched for an alternative. Snagging a decently priced copy of this long out of print remaster was luck on my part. All i have to say is if you care about sound stay far away from the RTL (2016 box set) it has nice extras which are tempting but yeah this 2000 MFSL Steve Hoffman remaster is the way to go. Best sounding version of RTL in my humble opinion.",

                "First off, if you're one of the people who've gotten this to work consistently, congrats and I'm glad you're happy.  There seems to be a lot of good reviews, so good for them.  And it is a great premise, the books\/DVD are very well done.  Where it falls short for me is in the actual device.  The plastic 'fingers' tend to drift a bit (they are removable), and they hit each other and mess things up.  But the major flaw is how it attaches to the guitar.  It clamps to the neck on the sides, however, the Chord Buddy needs to stay above the strings (so as to not hit the wrong notes), so it also needs something to hold the top solidly.  But any pressure on the buttons causes it to 'fall' down a bit, making contact with the wrong strings.  I'm going to try to clamp it so this doesn't happen, but with the finger drift, I'm not sure this will work anyway.  One wonders what would have happened if they had used better materials?\n\nUpdate:  figured I'd post this, maybe it will help others.  I had to file some edges of the fingers that were rubbing against each other.  Then, in order to stop them from 'drifting' back into each other, I had to glue them (fingers not removable anymore!).  No biggie for me, as I don't see doing half Chord Buddy, half fingering anyway.  The biggest fix came in keeping the Chord Buddy from tilting down.  I took a rubber band and looped it over the rounded plastic (by the tightening screw), underneath the neck and hooked to the other side.  This gives it enough tension so as to not continually flop down.\n\nWhile it now works, I can't give a better grade.  For this much money, it should work well out of the box.\n\nSecond Update:  I also picked up a copy of Rocksmith.  I would have to say that Chord Buddy makes you feel like you are playing a song (strumming a few chords is all it is really doing).  Rocksmith lets you play single notes and then graduate to more, while also making you feel like you are playing along.  I would have to recommend Rocksmith over Chord Buddy, and it's cheaper to boot!",

                "I have been using QSC K10s for close to a couple of years now. I am a solo performer, playing a variety of styles from acoustic singer-songwriter stuff to loop-driven electro-rock. I typically play bars and have probably used these for nearly 100 gigs at this point.\n\n3 K10s along with an&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Allen-Heath-ZED-10FX-Four-Mono-Mic-Lines-with-2-Active-D-I-3-Stereo-Line-Inputs-and-Onboard-Effects\/dp\/B003T77ZJU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Allen & Heath ZED-10FX Four Mono Mic\/Lines with 2 Active D.I., 3 Stereo Line Inputs and Onboard Effects<\/a>&nbsp;mixer make up my whole system, using two as mains and one as a monitor. My previous system was a powered Mackie box and passive 12\" speakers by Community and Yamaha.\n\nI have thus far been thrilled with the significant sound improvement I have experienced. The volume and clarity that these 10\" speakers produce is truly impressive. To give you an idea, I generally play rooms that are one to two thousand square feet in size and rarely turn my mains up much past 50%. At 60-75% levels (with mixer meters peaking around the zero mark) the music will cut through even the rowdiest bar noise.\n\nOne thing that's great about this 10\" model is the throw. With a super-wide 90 degree dispersion angle, sound fills out the space up close within a few feet, depending on placement (I prefer getting them up as high as possible on stands and using the clever 7.5 degree tilt function). The dispersion angle is also matched between the woofer and tweeter so you're never hearing just one or the other. 90 degrees is ideal for tight performance areas where you want people right in front of you to hear everything.\n\nThe trade-off here is that levels decrease quickly as you step back from the speakers. You can hear a significant difference as you get more than twenty or thirty feet away. While that could be seen as a negative especially for public address applications, I find it to be a win-win.  It essentially creates a \"full sound\" zone around the stage for the audience. I personally prefer creating a live music environment where people can hear a loud, full spectrum mix if they like but not have it forced on them wherever they are in the room. If your needs call for a speaker with more reach, the K12s (I've used them) throw a lot further and sound awesome as well.\n\nSpeaking of sound quality, I will say that while I think the K10 kicks the competition's a** throughout the EQ, it is especially spectacular in the mids and highs. Just playing an iPod through them, you will hear separated parts of the music in this range that you never did before. As far as your perfomances go, vocals and guitars will sparkle in a way you probably haven't heard out of a small cabinet.\n\nI don't want to downplay the bass response on these though. It is huge and far more than you would expect out of these little guys. The frequency coverage is absolutely there and can even be boosted if you utilize the DEEP switch. What you will NOT hear in the lower registers however is a ton of attack. They are more suited to adequately express a jazzy upright bass than they are to throw down the punch you want to hear from electronica or hip-hop (unless we're talking smaller spaces, they'll ROCK a house party DJs). Impressive but you'll find no magic here, that's why they make the Ksub.\n\nProspective buyers should also know that the 1 KW amp in these is Class D. That's not equivalent to 1000 watts in Class A for example. It's more than sufficient though and Class D amps are great for their light weight and power efficiency. I plug mine into a surge protector that powers a bunch of other devices simultaneously and have never had an issue.\n\nSignal routing is wildly flexible with the fantastic panel on the back. You can do whatever you want with these including play a small gig with one speaker alone. Just plug a mic, an instrument, and an iPod directly in.\n\nErgonomics are well done too. Knobs and switches are not fancy but easy to operate. There's also super sturdy, comfy handles on the top and on one side. Carrying two at once is easy (32 lbs. each) and saves you a trip back to the car.\n\nThe build quality is solid. I've always been careful with them but not used cases or bags and the only damage thus far has been cosmetic. The sides will scuff up pretty easily so use the duffels if thats important to you.\n\nI have not observed any malfunction up to this point other than some buzzing from the monitor once when it got rained on. After drying out, it didn't happen again. QSC has also put some serious limiting circuitry into these as well to protect themselves from blowing. I have more than once pushed my monitor too hard and reached this threshold. The signal simply cuts out when the the speaker cone experiences too much travel. Once you readjust the levels, you're back in business with no issue.\n\nI can't think of much to gripe about, the whole K series was very well thought out. I would love to incorporate a Ksub at some point as the crossover function is built into the entire line. These speakers aren't cheap at $700 a piece but you'll be paying for quality and design that cannot be found elsewhere.",
                "I will open with the Pros:\nReplayability - It's Hitman. What did you expect? You can go back and replay missions over and over to try for a cleaner, quicker kill or just fly right through it in a weekend like I did.\nLength of game - Do not listen to reviews such as Xbox Official Magazine saying it is a lengthy game. I finished it in one weekend. Friday night, Sat and Sunday. I would estimate around 10-12 hours solid play. BUT..If you go back and replay the missions for a better score, then it can drag out much further. But like I said, to play through and complete the tasks, it is not a long game.\nStory - Not bad at all. A few plot holes made me scratch my head but not bad.\nOverall Graphics - Better than the old Hitman games but nothing at all like cut scenes. Don't confuse cut scenes in the trailers as gameplay.\nCharacter dev - Although they give you a little info on specific targets, it didn't seem worth the effort to look any deeper into their back story. I just went forth on a killing spree. You point me in that direction? Here I go. There's no option to ever take a person into custody and question them. You kill anyone who you are pointed at.\nHand to hand - They kept it simple. between space bar, \"Q, W or E\" were your controls to hit when it told you to hit that key. It wasn't hard to do hand to hand. It wasn't 100% awesome like Batman but it was pretty good.\nCons:\nOMG why did all the people in close-up cut scenes talk with all their teeth showing? It really got annoying. I have never in my life met a person who talks like that. Also, the timing of the voice acting was bad. Serious delays in dialogue had me thinking the conversation was over then it started up again. So, voice acting wasn't bad, but developers did a poor job clipping it.\nGraphics - In regards to clipping, I would sometimes get blocked by phantom walls while sneaking up steps. I had to walk back and forth until it let me pass. Also, it would say there was a key point right in front of me (blinking sonar circles) and there was nothing there. No desk, nothing to pick up and it was floating in the air. More developer issues.\n(Minor Spoiler) Don't read if you can't take hints.\nSheer ease of killing other professional hitmen was a let down. I couldn't believe how easy it was to kill hired professionals.\n\nProfessional Edition: Do not waste your money. I got some weapons you can't even use in the game. It gives you the loadout at the begining and the weapons around the map are all based off that part of the game. No point in having access to the additional weapons.\nSniper challenge is ONE challenge. I beat it hands down and it never took me to a new challenge. It just lets you do the same challenge over and over.\nAll in all, it's a good game discounted at 1\/2 price or lower. Don't waste your $ on the Pro Edition."

                "When I saw that Sony had made Michael Jackson the latest artist to be anthologized in their \"The Essential...\" series, I really was surprised to be honest, since the series never actually covers of this magnitude. I am compelled to say that they only compiled this collection because they wanted to cash in on the revived interest in his music after his \"not guilty\" verdict.\n\nIf this is indeed, the case, then it shouldn't really matter, since the two disc \"The Essential Michael Jackson\" is actually an affordabel and, for the mosr part, comprehensive collection for a person who only wants to own one Michael Jackson cd. Now, I do not have this cd. I already own the four disc boxed set and \"Thriller\" (all a fan needs, really), but I already own must of the songs, so I feel that I am qualified to write a review for it.\n\nIf you're the casual Jackson fan, you pretty much get all the stuff you need: the Jackson 5 hits (though \"I'll Be There\" and \"Dancing Machine\" are strangely omitted), early solo hits, later Jacksons recoridngs, and all the hits from his trifecta of best selling albums: \"Off The Wall\", \"Thriller\", \"Bad\" and \"Dangerous\". The hits from those album make up well over half the collection. You will also get two post 1992 recordings, the 1995 megahit \"You Are Not Alone\" and the 2001 Top Ten single \"You Rock My World\".\n\nAs with most if not all entries in the \"Essential\" series (as with most compilations), there are some problems. Judging by how many songs are on each discs, some tracks are bound to be edited. Most of these songs are the single versions that we're used to hearing, so we shouldn't really be bothered buy this, except that \"Thriller\" loses its magic without the long intro of the footsteps approaching the door, etc. Also, there are some tracks left off, such as \"I'll Be There\", \"I Wanna Be Where You Are\", \"Dancing Machine\", \"Ease On Down The Road\", the Paul McCartney \"Say, Say, Say\" (the only one of Michael's solo number ones to be omitted, though it may be because it was originally released on a Paul McCartney solo album rather than one of Michael's), \"State Of Shock\" (The Jacksons' collaboration with Mick Jagger) and the Janet Jackson duet scream. However as a whole, this collection will not disappoint, and is highly recommended for casual fans.",

                "I waited to complete the entire course before writing this review and, in no particular order, these are my observations.\n\nI should tell you that my web skills are limited. I used Front Page for years and have created several very elementary Dreamweaver sites for family members. I'm in the process of trying to work more professionally (cleaner, less, and better code) and more creatively (a less stilted and more unique and appealing design). This course doesn't purport to be a web design course, it assumes that you already have a basic idea for a (relatively simple) website and it's going to teach you how to implement it. Don't expect inspiration.\n\nPOSITIVE:\n* Level: absolute beginner to intermediate.\n*  It is entirely DVD-based. The booklet (106 pages including index) that comes with the DVD just provides additional random information; it is in no way connected to the content or the sequence of the course.\n* The scope of the information presented is all that is needed for basic competence in the implementation of a simple Dreamweaver CS5 website. You do become familiar with the DW interface; the workflow; best practices; web and DW terminology; and basic website structure and creation.\n* The sequence and progression is logical and sequential. There is some reiteration of basic principles as the course progresses to clarify how something previously explained applies in a new situation.\n* The interface is very well thought out. You can go backwards or forwards easily. It has constant access to a table of contents that allows you to search (by both topic and subtopics) in case you want to navigate to a completely different topic. It allows you to bookmark (with long notes-to-self) on topics of interest you may want to keep coming back to. The interface coloring and design are neutral and un-intrusive. The screen always retains focus and the surrounding options melt away.\n* The course has the secondary purpose of preparing for the Adobe Certified Expert (ACE) test. Each main section has a practice test at the end.\n* Another asset is that the video transcript is captioned under the viewing screen (optional). This is particularly helpful if you're in in a public place where you can't turn on the sound.\n* All explanations of hard-to-grasp concepts (ex: the box model) are clearly demonstrated with visual examples. As a matter of fact, this is the clearest explanation I have ever seen of the box model.\n* I did find the booklet section on Fireworks instructive, since I have never used that program in the past. In fact, the entire booklet is very instructive and useful--it's just totally unrelated to the course on DVD.\n\nNOT SO POSITIVE:\n* Coverage of other concepts, such as content placement and positioning, are a little more basic and less detailed than I would have liked. I can't recall (or locate now) any reference to floats, whereas AP divs and frames (both older concepts) are well covered.\n* The narrator has a pleasant voice and clear diction, but is somewhat monotone and unexciting.\n* There is no \"search\" function or \"index.\" This makes it impossible to look up a term or a topic that is not specifically listed in the table of contents. I would have thought that the transcript text might have been searchable, but it isn't.\n* For my learning style, I would have preferred that the booklet function as support material for the video so I could follow along with text that directly reinforces the visual demonstration (and is easier to go back to or use as reference material.)\n* The bookmarks that you create when taking the course on your laptop are saved to that computer. If you want to change to your desktop, the bookmarks, obviously, are not there. So as a \"personal index\" these bookmarks have their limits.\n\nOn the whole, I do recommend this course. I wish I had taken it earlier, because it laid down the groundwork better than an online course that I had just taken. However, I think that, for a person who is learning-as-you-go (not just learning general theory but actually trying to apply it to a real website) it is essential to have reference material on Dreamweaver CS5, some sort of guidance on design principles, and a solid HTML and CSS anthology--all in well-indexed books.\n\nVideo and online courses teach you very well how to build their sample websites, but when you are stumped on YOUR website, you need to be able to supplement the general principles they taught you with a more on-point reference.",

                "So, this is what life comes down to when you are 50 years old:  reviewing dryer vent cleaners while sitting at your kitchen table waiting for American Idol.  This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much.  You kids who think it won't happen to you?\n\nIt will.  Sorry to burst your bubble.\n\nThat said, the product works great.  Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget.  One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater.  My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum.  (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.)  He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this.  I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed.  He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went.  He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977  - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram.\n\nNow our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.",

THRILLER has sold millions and millions of records and continues to sell and stand the test of time.\n\nThis collaboration is one of the most complete MJ collaborations that I have seen.  This one not only contains Jackson's solo career but also contains his work with the Jackson 5.  Unfortunately, maybe this should've been a 3 disc set, because there are a few of his most notable hits missing including \"I'll Be There\", a standard song in Jackson's arsenal.  Otherwise, it is probably the most complete compilation that you will find for MJ.\n\nIt is wonderful reliving hits such as \"I Want You Back\", \"Billie Jean\", \"Thriller\", \"Wanna Be Startin' Something\", \"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough\", and etc... 4 stars.",

The only thing telling you this is remastered is a little snippet in the booklet, which is basically just the cover, back, and a page with lyrics. It's all fairly pedestrian. I literally sent the first disc back because I thought it was the 80s disc. I cannot believe they went so cheap on these. It is literally almost impossible to tell this is a remastered disc.\n\nThe three disc Master of Puppets release is by far the best one for the affordable versions. The remaster here has some slight tweaking, but otherwise sounds nearly the same as the old disc. Dynamic range is still very good for metal. If you want to revisit these classics, these cheap editions are the way to do it. I just wish they had given the buyer any clue how to differentiate these besides the small snippet in the cheap booklet. Bare minimum quality digipack, but it is low cost I guess.

                "Calvin Klein ck one is a scent that I first tried about 15 years ago when I was a teenager. I loved the scent then and I still like it now. It is Unisex which means it can be used by Men as a cologne or by Women as a perfume. I tried it and so did my Husband. I personally liked it better on me. His cologne that he wears is a lot stronger and more masculine. The ck one fell a little flat in comparison. I do love it as a perfume though. It smells sweet on my skin and the violets, jasmine and Lilly scents really shine through.\n\nThe bottle that I received is 1.7oz. It is a decent size bottle that will last a long time...providing that you do not spill it. This comes to my one and only issue with this bottle. It has a screw on cap and no spray cap (like it shows in the picture). I am not sure if I received a box without the spray cap or if it just does not come with one. However, a spray top is necessary for me with fragrance. I have worn this 4-5 times already and I have already sloshed it all over my wrist once. Frankly, I am a klutz and this would be a pricey spill if I knocked the entire bottle over.\n\nThe 1.7oz is the most expensive size that you can buy (currently $28.82 per ounce). The 6.7oz bottle for the current price of $69 is a steal ($10.30 per ounce!). However, that is a lot of perfume. I would only recommend buying that size if you know that you or your gift recipient REALLY loves this perfume and will use it a lot. For me, this is an occasional perfume and the 1.7oz size will last me for years. The 1.7oz is big enough size wise to make a decent gift for a loved one. So, use your discretion and knowledge of the individual you are buying for when purchasing.\n\nI would recommend this perfume. I just hope that my bottle only having a screw top was an error and everyone else receives a spray bottle as pictured.",

I can not dispute that.  Sometimes I simply don't find them all that interesting. I enjoy the restaurant reviews, its helpful knowing of a few good suggestions when traveling, or even locally.  I find the advertising in the magazine to be a bid auspicious as it seems to cater only to those high members of society that are in serious need of spa treatments and an occasional face lift.  Maybe its tough finding advertising, but I find that it takes away from articles about our local government and issues.\nI do feel this is totally worth the subscription price, and you are bound to find 12 dollars of reading in a years time :)  This might even be a good gift idea from someone that is no longer in the area."

                "I have Nolo products I bought in the past and I have used Quicken since their first version (I got it from the original owners of the company in person).  Nolo makes (made) some valuable applications but they tend to look like something you would find in MSDOS 3.0.  Quicken, on the other hand has a very slick and easy to understand user interface.\n\nWillMaker Plus is very much a Nolo product. Although it contains the basic forms you buy it for, the user interface is so basic it looks like something you would find on PC's from the 1980's.  The willmaking app (the part that most people buy this for) consists of 7 questions.  Seriously, that's it. You are allowed to enter only what the software will let you enter and there are some really basic non-interactive guidelines that are at the same time too basic and also too confusing.\n\nI wrote my own will in about 10 minutes, but the software didn't permit me to include ANY specific details for someone to know what my \"final intentions\" are. I can't imagine anyone having such a basic lifestyle as to just say \"give it all to so-and-so\".  I think anyone could just hand-write that sort of thing on a piece of paper and hand it to their next of kin.  I expected the software to be more like TurboTax in that it would interview me about what the provisions of my mortgage are, what and where my investments are, what and where my life insurance policies are, what I owe and how to pay that off, what special provisions I may have for friends who are not in my will but who I may want to leave certain things that they've admired to.  But no.  None of the above.  Just 7 questions and a print-out of something that to me really has no practical value.\n\nI think Quicken is doing themselves a disservice to put their name on this product. It's not worth the 35 bucks and especially not worth the \"list price\" of 70. There are hundreds of websites you can go to and download a simple will form that will be just as useful to you as WillMaker Plus.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is that it does give you the convenience of having some basic forms all on one disk, a bit of a timesaver.\n\nBy the way, if you buy this toward the end of 2011, note that the \"free updates\" are only good through the end of December.",

                "This is the third version of Quicken Willmaker Plus I have used.  I liked the 2009 version.  Unfortunately, starting with the 2010 version, Nolo, the publisher of self-help legal books that produces this software, took away the living trust feature, which was a terrible move.  (Also, you're supposed to upgrade to a new version *every year*.  If you don't, the software won't update itself after the end of the version year -- i.e., Dec. 31, 2011 for the 2011 version -- which can cause problems as states [such as New York] do update their probate and other estate-related laws.)\n\nThis 2011 version does not come with the living trust feature, either, but does provide you with a link upon installation to access Nolo's online living trust product for free. This was probably in response to the uproar from their loyal customer base last year. While this does mitigate the problem somewhat -- living trusts are an essential part of estate planning for most people and must be included in an estate toolkit -- it means none of the information you enter in Willmaker Plus 2011, such as all the contact names and addresses and birthdays and phone numbers, carries over to the living trust part, essentially making you have to enter all that information again.\n\nOther than that, both the Willmaker itself and the online living trust software are solid estate planning products.  Of course, tools like this are best for simple situations.  How simple?  For example, in my case I'd like to attach a condition to my will that the people I'd like to be the personal custodians for my kids only become custodians if they relocate to my city.  It turns out I cannot do this in Willmaker.  What I have to do is go through the standard Q&A process of Willmaker, export the draft to Word, and then add the condition in Word myself.  This part is easy; the hard -- real hard -- part is I now need to pore over my state's will law to make sure my language is kosher.  I already know the condition itself is fine; I just have to make sure the way I write it -- since Willmaker didnt' write it for me -- will pass on probate.\n\nFor most families without complicated familial situations -- such as history of multiple divorces and remarriages or estranged children -- Willmaker Plus 2011 will be good for making wills, living wills (aka healthcare directives), powers of attorney, etc.  You can also write promissory notes and some other simple legal documents beyond wills.\n\nAnother thing I'm disappointed with Nolo and this version -- again I think Nolo is using the product as a cash cow rather than to really help its customers -- is it's little changed from the 2009 version, or even the earlier version I had used before.  The same typos (yes, TYPOS!) remain, and the same interface remains.  It seems every year they just change the update-expiration date of the program and the splash screen, and then sell it as a new version.  (And the price seems to have been going up, even though now it doesn't come with living trusts built-in.)  I find this practice unethical.\n\nMost likely this will be the last version of Willmaker I'll use.  I wasn't going to use the 2011 version, but got a chance to try it for free, hence I used it and this review.  There're books out there that show you step-by-step how to make wills and living trusts, books published by Nolo and by big-name publishers.  But in the end, I think next time I modify my will or living trust, I'm going to see an estate lawyer -- there are a few reasonable-cost ones in my community."

I now have a working copy, but did I just pay for the privilege?\n\nApart from that, this is the best way to buy Office. You can install this five times on five different computers which means that if you split the costs with four others you end up paying less than $20 a year (though Microsoft won't guarantee the price will be the same next year). You get the use of Office 365 days a year, with any improvements that transpire during that time.\n\nI like Office considerably, and this is basically Office 2013. Because I use Office a lot, I'm used to things that people get upset about. For instance, I feel very positive about the Ribbon which other people don't like. I find it hard to recommend anything else, and as long as Microsoft keep offering this at a low price it's a no-brainer.\n\nAll I dislike about this is the installation problem I've mentioned. Just be sure that if you buy this, your account is correct.",

                "I was curious as to how the Chord Buddy would work. Actually I was curious as to IF it would actually work, and this is what I've found thus far - Once you get the Chord Buddy installed on your guitar properly it works like a charm. I installed mine on a Squier Strat and found it was very easy to adjust properly. Within a minute or so I was playing chords easily and could work on my timing & strumming. Shortly thereafter I was playing LaBamba. I believe that it is important to make sure you install it absolutely in the proper position. I did find that it fits my Squier Strat better than the acoustic I also tried it on (although it does fit the acoustic, just not quite as well - a bit of string buzz, but still playable).\nI can't speak as to whether the Chord Buddy will actually help with finger dexterity (it very well could) or help actually learning to play the chords (it might) since I've had it less than a week, but it certainly helps me work on timing & strumming as I mentioned above.\nI do believe the Chord Buddy will be an excellent tool to get my daughter more interested in playing the guitar and that is definitely a good thing. I think it's a great idea and time will tell how well it helps with finger dexterity. But for now I give it 4 Stars as it is easy to use and actually quite fun.",

Obviously the books are hardbound allowing them to be more durable, but also the pages are printed on 80lb paper so they are thicker more durable pages than the original magazine releases.  The material has also been revised from the original print so they are the most complete and accurate of the guides to date.  I just received my guides recently and I have copy number 49647 of 50000.  When these are gone Prima has said that they will not be reprinted.

                "Beginning her career as a freelance knitter, Melissa Leapman has designed her own collection of wonderful stitch patterns. Yes, there are old favorites here, but the depth of new stitch techniques and ideas of how to work them into patterns has really helped to round out my large, huge, library of stitch encyclopedias. While some lace is covered, it is not a huge book of lace designs. The world has many. They are needed, but I don't make much lace. If you want reverse stockinette, cables, texture and strong fabrication, this is a great book.\n\nAll patterns are charted, as well as written and the colors tabbing the section make sense. There is little on, \"how to do basic stitches,\" taking up page space. While that information is important, I find the redundancy of the simple knit and purl to be a tree-wasting effort to round out some books, which would be better off without them. If you cannot knit, nor purl, perhaps this is not the book to start with. Which is fine! It's part of the journey of knitting. There is no end to this road of interest and there should not be, Texture, working patterns into garments and general beauty with color photographs, that are not over-the-top, but show the finished pattern in good light, are the hallmarks of this book.\n\nIf you knit can you exist without it? Well, of course. If you want to get a book with stitches I've not found elsewhere, then this is a must own. So much so, that after buying the edition for my Kindle, I got the book. I can't leave an entire sticky notepad's worth of paper in my Kindle. I can in the book and that's what I've done to this book. It sits in my pile in my studio space, within reach at all times. Right next to my Barbara Walker books and Vogue stitch dictionaries. I use it daily and make up swatches often, just to get a feel for them and to learn. Anyone who wants more will find this book a great resource. This is all my own thoughts. I am not being solicited in any way and  believe me, I can slam with the best of them.\n\nEnjoy and get out the highlighter and notes. You're going to need them.",

                "I really enjoyed the Dirt series of racing games.  I actually started with the Colin McRae Rally 3 demo, which came before Dirt.  Dirt 1 was a nice game with lots of different types of races in varied environments, including Pike's Peak.  You got to race semi trucks, cargo trucks, trophy trucks, SUVs, and rally cars in Dirt 1.  The advancement was like a pyramid, unlocking levels as you go. I have a Toyota Tundra, so it is easy to like a game that has a Toyota Tundra to race in it.  Dirt 2 made it more radical with nice music and an attitude.  The races were longer and became more X-Games like. I enjoyed the Baja races very much. But, I did not like the Microsoft Live part of it where it takes a long time to get initiated, patched, etc before you can actually play for the first time. Once you get past this, things get better. The choice of vehicles were more limited, but the liveries try to make up for it. Dirt 3 keeps the same attitude and cool music, but also has the same Microsoft Live treatment: sign in, patch , etc. before the first game time.  Once you get past this, it does get better.  At first, I could not get used to the way the game downshifts automatically in the turns to automatically slow you down.  I moved the difficulty up a notch to intermediate and it was much better and more of what I was expecting.  I use a gamepad to play on the PC.  I was pleasantly surprised that my 9800 GTX 512 MB plays this game rather well at 1680x1050 (no AA).  The races are largely rally with some interesting winter-time truck races in the snow.  The cars are not quite as varied as I would like.  I also hate that there is in-game content that can be purchased additionally from Microsoft Live.  Come on! I already paid for the game and there are some levels that are pay to play, so you won't really finish the season until you pony up more funds to Microsoft Live.  Many of the cars are available to purchase too.  That is cheesy and not appreciated.  You don't need to purchase these to advance though.  The gymkhana events are interesting and challenging. Being a hoonigan takes practice, patience, and many banged up cars. The Ken Block videos on youtube really inspired me to practice as I had no idea what gymkhana was before Dirt 3.  I do miss the Baja style of offroading from Dirt 2.  Dirt 3 seems to have a focus on other things, but it is still fun overall. For $12, I got my money's worth.  Maybe I will get Dirt Showdown for some demolition derby excitement, or maybe not.",

The 2 instructors do a great job. They don't get over technical and keep a good pace.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3\/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!",

                "I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench \/ allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!",

                "Whoa!!!!! Where did this come from? Without any hype or media attention, Sony has just released \"The Essential Michael Jackson\" (37 tracks, 157 min.), perhaps the ultimate Michael Jackson compilation.\n\nCD 1 (20 tracks, 79 min.) cover the period up to and including the \"Thriller\" album, starting with the best known Jackson 5 singles such as \"ABC\" and \"I Want You Back\", then shifting to the Jacksons. It would have been better to include \"State of Shock\" or \"Lovely One\" instead of \"Enjoy Yourself\". CD1 finishes off with 7 of the 9 \"Thriller\" album tracks (the other 2 being \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"The Lady in My Life\"; it's still hard to believe how successfull that album really was, and how many hits were relased from it, in the days when \"radio tracks\" meant actual vinyl single releases). This was of course Michael at his absolute best, now 23 years ago.\n\nCD2 (17 tracks, 78 min.) compiles 8 tracks from \"Bad\" and 7 from \"Dangerous\", and finishes off with \"You Are Not Alone\" from HIStory and \"You Rock My World\" from Invincible. In other words: only 2 tunes from the post-1992 era, and rightfully so, even though the HIStory and Invincible albums are not nearly as bad or mediocre as many would like you to believe. The only track that arguably should be on here (but, at 78 min. already, at the expense of what other track then?) is \"Scream\", the No. 1 duet with sister Janet.\n\nIn the end, this \"essential\" compilation is better than any other compilation available (HIStory Vol. 1; Number Ones, etc.) as it covers both the Jackson 5\/Jacksons era and his solo output. It's very strange to me that this was released without any hype or advertizing campaign, but the main thing is that it's out and available. Hihgly recommended!",

                "The \"Learn by Video\" program for Flash CS5 would make a nice alternative to an introductory book - especially for visual learners.  I'd worked through the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Adobe-Flash-Professional-CS5-Classroom-in-a-Book\/dp\/0321701801\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Adobe Flash Professional CS5 Classroom in a Book<\/a>&nbsp;- and found that to be more comprehensive in its coverage, but there is a different emphasis here and I found I learned quite a bit that I didn't know or that wasn't clear before.  The little booklet that comes with the guide is an extremely useful introduction to design principles that are essential to effective working in Flash.\n\nThere are several chapters on different introductory-level topics in Flash CS5.  Each is broken up into different sections, and usually these can be completed in under ten minutes each.  That makes this easy to work through in short sections.  You can set bookmarks to remember where you left off - although it would be nicer if the program saved your progress directly and remembered for you where you left off.  The exposition is clear, but perhaps a bit dry.  There's no hint of humor here, and I always find it helps to make verbal lessons a bit more interesting and memorable.  Each section tells you what you are going to learn, gives you an explanation and a tutorial you can follow along using one of the project files included on the dvd, and then explains what you have learned.\n\nThe focus here is on learning how things work and what things mean at a fairly basic level.  You don't get very advanced, and by the end of things you'd really just have a rough idea of how things work in Flash, but it is very clear.  They assume a listener who is just getting started with Flash, and, while the lessons are sequential and they build upon each other, they remind you what you've learned and how to do things several times.  Sometimes that's a bit frustrating - in a beginner's level textbook it's easy just to skim through the repetition when it is familiar - with video it's harder to skim through what is inessential without missing the important bits.  That's one reason to prefer something like the \"Classroom in a Book\" series, rather than the Video Classroom approach.\n\nOne thing I got here more clearly than in the \"Classroom in a Book\" for Flash CS5 is an emphasis on best practices - how to manage projects so as to be completely clear, and how that helps to achieve control over the project.  There is more explanation here - more whys behind the hows.  I thought the chapter on Action Script was excellent for giving a clear concept of how it works as an \"object based\" language - even though you'd only be able to do some very rudimentary things after working through the entire chapter, you'd have a pretty decent understanding of how the language works and a good basis for further learning.  There are video files on the disk that allow you to follow along on what they show you in the tutorials.  One thing they don't make clear is that to work with them you have to copy the assets folder to your hard drive and open and work with the projects there.  (I find it most convenient to backup the entire dvd to my hard drive and play it from there - since that means it's available and ready whenever I want to work through a section, and it also helps to protect the original disk from scratching).\n\nOverall, it's a good introduction to Flash and the emphasis on \"Best Practices\" serves as a useful complement to the \"how to\" guides you can find in other introductory Flash books.  I do have a few minor gripes:  the navigation through the chapter files is not as intuitive as I'd like: there are sections and subsections, and you can go to the next section in a chapter by clicking the \"Next Video\" button.  But: when you get to the end of a subsection, the \"Next Video\" button is not enabled and you have to go back to the main index and then open up the chapter index again to get to the next section in the chapter.  Several words in the projects are misspelt (e.g. \"Hawaiin\" instead of \"Hawaiian\"), and I also noticed that at least one of the project files they encourage you to use was missing (the \"inverseKinematics_start.fla\" file from chapter 9).  Still, the guide as a whole is very helpful and clear - and the emphasis on design principles in the included booklet makes this a very helpful overview and introduction to a rich and complicated program."

                "I have to admit that one of my paranoid fears is that my computer will crash and that I'll lose all of my files and projects that I've spent a long time working on. One positive feature of Office 365 is the SkyDrive which enables you to save your documents and projects to the cloud and access them from other locations. I also like that 365 makes it possibly to easily collaborate on projects by inviting others to access the document. The other person does not have to have the same version of Office that you do, it can pull up the document in a browser and they can view and make changes as needed. You can also work on SkyDrive documents when you're offline and then they'll update when you have an internet connection again (BUT if the document was updated at another location and you don't have internet access, then you won't be accessing the most up-to-date version, which I view as a bit of a liability.) I have been known to save important documents to both my SkyDrive and my computer just as a back-up in case the Internet gods decide to shut up the data heavens.\n\nAn added feature of Office 365 is access to Office Mobile Apps. Unfortunately, my smartphone (HTC Desire) is not compatible with the Office Mobile App and so I can't make use of the mobile features. However, the subscription does include the option of adding up to five mobile devices (but I imagine they have to be fairly recent mobile devices or you might run into the problem I had of the device being incompatible with the app). I was kind of bummed that it won't work on my device. It would have been convenient to be able to access my documents on the go, but oh well, what can you do.\n\nInstallation is fairly easy. You just go to the website, enter the product key and connect it to your Microsoft account (or you can start an account with any e-mail address). It will let you download the software on up to five computers, BUT as the name Office 365 indicates, you will only have access to the software for 365 days. After that point you will have to pay all over again for another year's access to the software. The positives of that is that you will always have the most up-to-date Office software (automatic updates are included in the subscription), but the obvious con is that you'll be perpetually paying for a subscription. Honestly, my personal preference would be just to own the software outright (I'm OK with not having the latest and greatest version). They do throw in a few extra perks to help lessen the pain of an annual subscription: Skype 60 minutes a month world calling & SkyDrive with 20 GB storage.\n\nIt did take a little while for the program to download, but if you have any experience with Office products, it is pretty easy to find your way around. I do like that you have the option of downloading on up to five computers and five mobile devices, but you do have to be prepared to repay for the right to access the software annually. If you're OK with that, then I think you'll enjoy Office 365. It's user-friendly and helps bring accessible technology to our society that's increasingly mobile and connected. I like that my documents can go with me wherever I am.",

                "GLO is a visually stunning bible program with so much to offer. Gorgeous graphics, a unique interface, beautiful easy-on-the eyes bible pages, and so much more it's overwhelming. You can go from casual reading to in-depth historical research with a few clicks. There's so much to GLO...I'm still discovering stuff about it.\n\nGLO at its base offers the bible in five versions, an atlas, a timeline, topical, media, and a place for your stuff. Reading the bible on GLO is a joy. The pages are laid out beautifully - like a book displayed on a screen. Makes it easy to read. In the bottom you can view commentaries or add your own notes. You can also see notes that other have made via YouVersion. (Nice feature!) Also, it will display any media (video, pics, and more) that may be relevant to the part of the bible you're reading. If you right-click on bible passages, another sub-menu appears to copy it or take your study further.\n\nGLO's gorgeous screens reminds me Linux Ubuntu's darkly colorful Unity interface mixed with Apple's love of icons all in a unique interface package. Icons glow and grow, screens slide, all on a black background - except for when you're reading the bible. Your work sessions are recorded as icons you can return to. The different parts of the menu and program options are accessed on sliding tabs and icons. This is not a flat bible program - it's a 3D bible world that you are navigating through. Is visually exciting, but the possibility to get lost or wander is too easy as well.\n\nBe forwarned: you do need a very capable computer with a good amount of processing power. GLO is graphically intensive. Icons glow and fade, the background shifts, something is always moving making it visually exciting. However, I don't doubt this will tax some older computers graphics capabilities. Make sure you have the minimum requirements (hopefully more) so you can enjoy this program for how it is created.\n\nThe one thing that annoys me to pieces is that I really don't know how to process all this information. I have a fully loaded and gorgeous program and no skills to how to use it to my benefit. I wish GLO had included a follow-along tutorial explaining all the different features, how they work together, and the different ways I can benefit from it. I did see a short video trailer about GLO and it just affirmed that there's so much that can be done with this program that I haven't conceived yet.\n\nI'm also disappointed that there isn't a Strong's concordance or similar (or at least I haven't found it yet) to do word research on the Greek or Hebrew meaning. That's so automatic with so many other bible programs it's surprising not to find it with this one.\n\nGLO is quite frankly mind-boggling! It offers so much that you are pretty much blown away. It offers a stunningly beautiful interface and a tons of information and resources to draw from. It also offers the ability to link your information to an iPhone\/iPad app so you can carry it around with you. The only drawback is that you do need a rather powerful computer to get the most out of it without lag or frustration. I also believe a tutorial is would have been sorely helpful so you get the most bang for you buck rather than just wandering around.",

                "Maximum PC is a magazine for electronics freaks, offering many different articles about electronics; how to buy them, how to repair them, how to get the most out of them, and how best to replace them. This magazine is aimed in one primary direction: Making the most out of the electronic devices available. This is accomplished through the many instructional articles, how to guides, and question and answer sessions.\n\nWhen Maximum PC isn't offering words of wisdom on ways to improve your life with electronics, the magazine is usually offering reviews of new products. The reviews section is one of the largest parts of each issue and while it does a nice job bringing new products to the forefront, the reviews are often less than stellar. Rather than analyze a few products in- depth, Maximum PC instead prefers to offer shorter reviews of many products. This part of the magazine seems more concerned with quantity than quality, in contrast to most of the remainder of the magazine.\n\nOne thing about Maximum PC that isn't to my liking is the technical nature of many articles. Maximum PC likes to get to the root of things (literally), and it is common to find articles talking about circuits, memory, and other boring subjects. This is fine for those who take their technology to the extremes, but I have no interest in learning about the inter-workings of the wiring inside my personal computer or the electronic pulses that cause my printer to respond on queue. This is a little too much technology for me, but I know there are some readers who will relish the depths that Maximum PC goes to when it strips down electronic devices into their component parts.\n\nOverall, Maximum PC is a pretty good electronics magazine for young and middle- aged adults. It loses me from time to time when it gets overly technical, but it still ranks as a good magazine about electronics. The numerous question and answer sessions, the educational articles, and the product reviews make this a magazine worth reading."

It's one on one training presented by Tim Grey and Mikkel Aaland. The program truly has just about everything to get you up and running full hilt. You'll progress from the very beginning of setting Lightroom up to importing photos, developing them, exporting them and everything in between. It does not contain everything that anyone would want in an educational program - that would be a practical impossibility. However, this program contains 10 hours of video training: you hear how a procedure occurs and you see how it's done, along with advice and opinion. There's even a testing procedure included and reference booklet. You can also copy selected video tutorials. I've had and have been using Adobe Lightroom for a couple years and recently upgraded to Lightroom 3. I've books written about Lightroom 3 by well known authors but I found reading about it was just a little too tedious and finally decided to find out how to make it work for me.

From my perspective, I have taken a lot of time to get used to the interface and explore the features.  As somebody who is admittedly not an expert in the subject matter, I find the interactive features to add new dimensions to the content that is presented.  And considering the amount of investment required to produce software of this caliber, I think this program is a great value.\n\nMany have reported installation problems.  For PC use, I can report that I had no problems installing this on Windows 7.  The program required that I install Microsoft .NET framework 4 first, and the related updates.  But as of November 2011, it seems like some of the installation problems have been fixed.\n\nThe initial install allows you to access the basic features, but you will need to register to use things like the Atlas.  The actual space required to install the software is about 1 GB for a PC and 200 MB for a Mac.  You can use the interface to stream the data off the internet, and while there is some lag it wasn't significant for me.  But yes, if you want all the files on your local hard drive you will need to use all 3 disks and it will take up about 18 GBs.  That seems like a small price to pay for those who choose to have all the content stored locally.\n\nThis product is advertised to work for multiple devices.  While I had no problem with a PC install, it seems getting it to work on a tablet or iPod requires separate installs.  I will update this further once I confirm that my license key works for all the devices.\n\nThe best features for me are the Atlas, which integrates historical content from the Bible with geographical data and images.  This is the kind of resource that I think would be very valuable when visiting the various regions of Europe, Africa and the Middle East depicted in the Bible.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis is a very good program.  Though it takes some time to learn the interface, I think it's worth the effort.  Enjoy.",

LR is relatively user-friendly, you need very little instruction to get started. I never had any training, book or instructions of anykind, but always felt efficient with the software.\n\nWell, I think it is great that I now have access to this training video. It was kind of long (10 hrs.), so finding the time to watch them was a challenge. Especially for me, as I already know how to use the software. But of course, you will pick up things that you don't know before or how to do it better. And it is true. I learned more than I expected. So no matter how experienced you are or how user-friendly the software is, you will definitely gain something from it.\n\nIf you are a new user of LR, it could be a little intimidating. If you are a casual user who only need to manage your photo and run slideshow, you don't need this video. But if you want more like publishing, converting and optimizing images, I recommend this training video.",

It just seems like bait set out for some young naive prey to fall for.  Does anyone honestly believe that personal information is collected for no particular reason?  I don't care what they say publicly.  Any assurances of privacy protection are quite hollow without close oversight, and nobody's looking.  It's quite a different thing to knowingly step out into a multiplayer server where you know you're being tracked, but this type of continuous spying is something more.  That aside, this carrot on a stick has more problems than just security.\n\nCONS - Requires open Internet (Windows Live) to play.  Annoying interface.  Continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do.  Most settings don't keep between sessions.  Setting up a race takes way too long.  Irritating \"music\" you can't turn off (it keeps coming back).  Takes too long to unlock things.  Entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating I just wanted out.  Video stuttering (possibly my equipment).\n\nPROS - Eye candy.  Plenty of game modes.  Enough tracks to get going.  Fairly good variety of cars.  Scaled difficulty levels from casual to advanced.\n\nI think this franchise, like many others, continues soley for the purpose of farming user information; where it seems the real money is.

For Michael Jackson, he is one that has been tormented bith ways. Arguably, after his child molestation trial vindication, many wonder if he will ever be heard from again. Arguably, that will be a test from time. Nevertheless, what he has accomplished as a innovator keeps on showing in his music and his videos. Although there have been adequate collections that need improvement, there hasn't been anything loosely definitive, until now.\n\nThe Essential Michael Jackson, a collection reflection his career in three folds: Jackson 5, Jacksons, and on his own, is a double album reflecting his well-received career. The songs here have really been remastered very well and still withstand that test of Michaels' Moonwalking mayhem. The collection includes most of his biggest hits including Beat It, Wanna Be Staring Something, ABC, I Just Can't Stop Loving You, Black Or White, and You Walk My World. The compilation does show quite a lot, but like most collections, there are just a few glitches to the parade. The album overshadows a few of Michael's big tracks including Scream with Janet Jackson, Say, Say, Say with Paul McCartney, One More Chance, his last song from his Number Ones collection, and others die hard Jacko maniacs would want.\n\nAll in all, Michael Jackson was strange, but one of a kind. Yet, his music will keep everyybody rocking with him for a very long time. Hopefully, he should try to do it again soon. What ever reflection, The Essential Michael Jackson is one of the very few definitive hits collections for 2005.\n\nAlbum Cover: B+\n\nMastering: A-\n\nSongs: B 1\/2+\n\nPrice: B\n\nOverall: B 1\/2+",

If I ever become an owner of a tablet, IPod Touch or IPad, I plan on downloading the Glo Bible IPad app & syncing my notes and\/or bookmarks to the device. I hope to prepare presentations for Children's Church. By the way, the collection of media in this program is amazing. There's HD video,  articles, photos, art, 360 degree virtual tours & more. I needed to use 'Help' to learn how to find my way around.\n\nAs a test,  I did a search for Galatians 5:22; first it turned up nothing, but then I did a search in Galatians & also on the home page both searches pulled up the verse, 2 photos and a map. Clicking on the verse took me to the Galations 5,  the highlighted Bible passage, study notes and a map. Clicking the photos brought up the photo, its description and other pertinent info.  Clicking on the map brought up even more information. By the way, the amount of information that is brought up can be overwhelming.\n\nCheck out The Glo Blog, News & Updates on All Things Glo, g l o b i b l e. com \/ blog\/  to learn how to use Glo in your presentations, and the usefulness of the right-click context menu. Clicking on 'Features' at the top of the page might be helpful to you too. Be sure to use the 'help' menu in this program too. If the web address isn't showing in my review, just do a search for Glo Bible Blog to find the web page.\n\nThis program has many features, as I used it, I could only think that it needed a few more. To make this program perfect & even more useful to me, I'd like to see the following added:\n\nAudible dictionary; I'd like to be able to click on a word, go to the definition & also hear how it's pronounced.\n\nA few more Bible versions; currently it has NIV 1984 & 2010, KJV, The Message & ESV. I'd like to see NLT added. I'd also like the Bible versions in parallel format so I could read the same passage in different versions side-by-side.\n\nI wish the Bible timeline also showed the events happening in world history.\n\nAnd, I  wish the Life Application Notes were included.\n\nIn my opinion, adding these items would make this software perfect!\n\nThis program is huge with many, many interactive features; it can be overwhelming. Take your time, don't feel intimidated & soon you'll be comfortable with the wealth of information found in Glo Premium.\n\nUPDATE: I recently rec'd an IPod Touch & added the Glo Bible App; now I have Glo Premium on my IPod Touch, it syncs with the program on my laptop. Some of the Premium features are not included in the IPod app. I'm loving this on the IPod.",

You can then move one key at a time and learn to finger chords. Meanwhile this gets you playing right away.\n\nSometimes I have to adjust it just right so the chords play correctly. It will not play as well as when  you learn fingering but is is an easy way to learn to play..",

                "The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.",

                "Gorilla glue might be very strong but it is not user friendly for woodworking. It has some major drawbacks. It is not water soluble so you cannot wipe the excess with a wet rag (I had to use lacquer thinner). It expands quite a bit which means even if you wipe the excess initially, you are still going to have it coming out of the joint. Don't even think about using it to glue anything without using clamps, as the expansion of the glue will cause the parts to move. The bottle cap is cheap and it broke at the bottle when I tried to pull off the cap (which of course glued itself to the nozzle).\nI've gone back to conventional woodworking glues and the new ones (tite-bond) are very strong so there is no real advantage to Gorilla glue.",

                "This Windows \"program\" is a hodge-podge amalgamation of a variety of eBooks, PDFs, and help guides without integration and coordination.  Confusion was the only consistent theme in this application.  Put out by Quicken, the documents are actually created by Nolo, which is a trusted source of legal information.  I'd suggest buying their books instead.\n\nThe program includes sections on: Buying or Selling a Business; Contracts for Goods and Services; Corporate Minutes and Consents; Forming a Business; Hiring Workers; Leasing Space; LLC Minutes and Consents; Managing Finances; Buying and Selling Real Estate; and Tax Forms.\n\nIn these sections, instead of giving you a handy Microsoft Word Document that you can fill in obvious blanks on, the program makes you go through a step by step interview and often doesn't remember the information you enter from one form to another so you must enter your name, the name of the business and so forth all over again.  Nor does it integrate with any contact managers so you can easily fill in from there.  When your interview is complete, the document saves only in text or RTF format, which are highly compatible with most programs but at this point, .doc is pretty standard.\n\nMany of the items in these sections are simply Adobe Acrobat forms without the ability to edit or annotate them unless you have something besides Acrobat reader.\n\nIncluded in the program are \"checklists\"  that are very short guides on very weighty subjects such as \"How to Form an LLC\" and \"How to Set Up Tax Reporting and Accounting\".  All these checklists do though is point you to other Nolo books or websites and are unable to offer any advice in and of themselves.  In other words, pretty much worthless.\n\nMost frustrating to me was the business library which were simple PDFs (or Windows antiquated \"Book Reader\" format of:  Starting & Running a Small Business; Tax Savvy for Small Business; The Manager's Legal Handbook; How to Write a Business Plan; and Business Loans From Family and Friends.  Unfortunately, these books were previous versions and the newest versions of these books (despite the 2011 in the title of the program) are available elsewhere.\n\nAdditionally, also included with the program is a printed book called \"Your Little Legal Companion\" that has absolutely nothing to do with business and contains basic personal legal information that borders on the silly such as \"Moving in with your Lover\" and \"Getting Old.\" These tidbits of advice had little substantive or legal value and were more like a sidebar from a Sunday newspaper magazine than anything that could be used for real reference or planning.\n\nUpon registering the book, Nolo will send you a PDF of their book \"101 Law Forms for Personal Use\".  Again, this is just a PDF and not any templates that can actually be used within a program.\n\nCombined together the program is a good value for all that you are getting.  However if you don't really need all that or want the current versions, I recommend purchasing this collection of eBooks and PDFs individually.",

Although it does not deal with programming in detail, it does cover basic concepts of object-oriented programming, variables, conditional statements, and functions. The rest covers working with artwork and text; library and symbols; layers, timeline, animation, and tweens; working with files, sound and video. You'll learn the fundamentals; you won't learn how to create those fancy user interfaces on those fancy sites; that's for a more advanced class.\n\nAs with other products in this series, there are some usability issues. At the top of the interface, there's a \"Previous Video\" button and \"Next Video\" button. The \"Next Video\" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you'll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read \"Take Test\" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists\/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.\n\nThere's a \"Watch and Work\" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you'll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.\n\nAll in all it's a good way to get started in Flash programming, if you don't have the patience for going through a book. Know what to expect; you'll learn the basics, but you'll need to carry on the learning process yourself, by seeking out more advanced information or learning materials.",

In fact, finding the time to watch the entire ten hours at all might be difficult.  Don't be fooled though as any time you invest in going through this video will improve your usage of Lightroom.

This is the one to own however since it captures all of his big hits and well represents my two favorite albums \"Off The Wall\" and \"Thriller\". His best songs are all here\" Rock With You, Don't Stop Til You Get Enough, Beat It, Billie Jean,The Girl Is Mine, Human Nature, etc. as well as his early hits with the Jackson Five and the great later albums like \"Bad\" and \"Dangerous\". THIS IS THE BEST SOUNDING representation of these hits I have ever heard. There are 37 cuts. Michael was indeed an American tragedy and a pop music icon. If you can only own one CD, this is the most logical choice. My only quibble is the omission of \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" which was my favorite Jackson Five song. At one time, he was selling over one million albums-CD's a day (1983-84). He changed the course of pop music history and his legacy will live on despite the cynics. Highly recommended!",

                "The current trend for software companies is to provide \"software as a service\" (SaaS) where the user licenses an application for a finite amount of time.  There are pros and cons for the user here - since it's basically cloud-delivered, you don't need to worry about holding physical discs or keys; you can more easily use it on multiple devices (including Microsoft tablets - sorry iOS\/Android users); you don't pay for it longer than you need it.  This model could work well for apps with specific uses that would otherwise be overly expensive, e.g. Photoshop (Adobe also rolled this SaaS plan out earlier this year to much anguish).  However, for the basic word processing, spreadsheet and presentation uses that most people look to Office for, this model could actually turn out to be more expensive in the long run.  Put another way, most people are likely using a version of Office that is many years old and that's still fine for their simple uses - that Word 2007 (or even 97!) that you purchased for perpetuity still lets you type, format and print those handful of letters that you need to create each year.  So I believe that only power users of Word, Excel and\/orPowerPoint and\/or homes with multiple PCs would really benefit from the SaaS pricing model.  Others will likely be frustrated when forced to fork over another $99 (unless the cost goes up, which there are no guarantees that it won't) every 12 months.  Microsoft packages some online goodies to soften this blow - Skype minutes and 20GB of online storage - but many either won't use this or will know that there are cheaper\/free ways to get the same elsewhere.\n\nInstallation was as straightforward as any Microsoft install.  You will need to tie it to a Microsoft online account for the cloud storage purposes.\n\nIn use, I find that each subsequent version of Office gets worse in its user experience design.  I was a wiz with Office 2003, zipping through keyboard shortcuts and quickly formatting great-looking documents and presentations.  Since the new ribbon-based navigation interface in 2010, I feel that Office apps are hiding most of their functions and how to navigate through the menus\/options.  Simply put, I don't feel that these newer versions of Office enable me to be as productive or creative as I had been with past versions.  I know that I'm not alone in this view, but unfortunately it seems that Microsoft is more focused on their SaaS profit model and shoehorning in touch screen gimmicks (as if everyone will then run out and buy a touch-screen PC, upgrade to Windows 8, and\/or grab a Surface tablet).",

It is nice, but not memorable.  It's the kind of signature scent one wears if one wants to wear a signature similar to everyone else's."

                "I have tried three different types of Gorilla glue and this one is the best, although still VERY average.  I cannot recommend it as it is not truly \"general purpose\".  While it works decently, if you don't mind the excess foaming on paper to wood, wood to wood or cardboard to plastic, it totally fails on plastic to metal or brick.  It is WORTHLESS on brick to brick (yes they are bare, unpainted bricks), and don't even think about using it to stick anything to concrete blocks.\n\nTheir Product Description is all hype and I found to be totally untrue.\n\n\"Gorilla Glue is the finest all purpose premium polyurethane wood glue available today.\"\n\n* I have found several better products, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Elmer-s-Ultimate-Glue-P9417-16Oz-Ultimate-Poly-Glue\/dp\/B000MVOXGO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Elmer's Ultimate Glue - P9417 16Oz Ultimate Poly Glue<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Elmer-s-E9416-All-Purpose-Glue-All-Max-8-Ounces\/dp\/B0045PS6K2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Elmer's E9416 All Purpose Glue-All Max, 8 Ounces<\/a>&nbsp;just to name two.\n\n\"Gorilla Glue is environmentally friendly, incredibly strong, 100 waterproof, will not freeze, requires no mixing, does not become brittle with age and will not expand or contract in the glue joint.\"\n\n* It is NOT incredibly strong!!  I first tried to glue a plastic wheel barrow what has a 6 in split in it with this this product.  After TWO days of drying (and scraping a lot of foaming residue) I dumped a load of dirt and it immediately split on first load.  Okay, maybe not enough surface area to make a good bond.  I took a strip of flexible plastic and roughed up both original surfaces and the new reinforcement strip and surface that would be in contact with it with 80 grit sandpaper, AND I also CLAMPED the reinforcement strip firmly, but not tightly, in 3 locations.  Again, after 3 or 4 days (home owner, don't have to use wheel barrow every day luckily) of setting time I went to use wheelbarrow.  Put shovel in wheelbarrow and let handle drop to side.  Guess what?  Yup, you guessed it, crack split again faster than cheerleaders doing splits at end of their routine!  So much for strong.\n\n* It has become brittle on two or three projects for me, mostly ones exposed to intense sunlight or freezing temperatures. And then FAILED.\n\nAs to water proof & requires no mixing, I guess these are correct, but so are almost all other resin and polyurethane adhesives; environmentally friendly -- what about it is enviro friendly?  More hype to get tree huggers and green freaks to buy a product I suppose.\n\n* * Plus this stuff foams up worse than a dog that has just tried to eat a toad and is very messy to clean up and it surface even when capped tightly in bottle tends to become rock hard and requires coat hanger to break up to get to adhesive.\n\nI have relegated what I have left to NON critical small insignificant wood\/paper bonding and will NOT be purchasing again.",

                "While it has been six months since the tragic and heartbreaking death of Michael Jackson, many people have recently rediscovered what had made him such a strong and influential singer, and the icon he was. Not the jokes he was labeled that dogged him through the past several years. Nevertheless, it has been quite easy to forget in any such way why he was recognized as the \"King of Pop\". Yet, there have been several different greatest hits collections that have showcased why Michael Jackson was so assertive, and pushing the envelope each and everytime. Back in 2005, at the time he was acquitted of the well-publicized child molestation charges, Sony released The Essential Michael Jackson through the heartbreak he endured. Well, earlier this past year, before his death it was re-released and nicely expanded to its 3.0 series. Here is the result.\n\nThe Essential Michael Jackson 3.0 expands what made The Essential Michael Jackson a strong re-introduction to his music to a whole new generation. But, overall 3.0 handles it a bit better by adding some of the overlooked tracks that showed why Michael was a icon. The songs here have all been remastered well, as the collection showcases from each of Michael incarnations with his brothers through The Jackson 5, The Jacksons, and his solo efforts. The collection includes a lot of his great and distictive tracks from I Want You Back, the understated Enjoy Yourself, as well as gems from his solo smashes from Thriller, Got To Be There, Rock With You, Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough, as well as Man In The Mirror, to his final major hit, 2001's You Rock My World. The extra disc also expands mostly well, by including some of Michael's tracks that were sadly overshadowed like Say, Say, Say with Paul McCartney, the deep They Don't Care About Us, and the intimate Stranger In Moscow. Yet, with all the hits from the collection, there were a few tracks that were sadly overlooked like Scream, his duet with his sister Janet Jackson, Gone Too Soon (which its video showed the beloved chile Ryan White whom embattled AIDS), and other songs like Childhood and Earth Song.\n\nOverall, despite a few overshadowed songs, The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0 is a strong and simple greatest hits album for anyone whom has yet to own a Michael Jackson record, and wants to remeber why he was so special and enduring to the music industry. If you have not yet owned a Michael Jackson record, this honestly would be a great place to start for your listening pleasure. R.I.P. Michael, you've rocked the world, and so many hearts along the way.\n\nAlbum Cover: B\n\nSongs: B 1\/2+\n\nPrice: B+\n\nRemastering: B+\n\nOverall: B 1\/2+",

I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed.  He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went.

'East To West' is already in that category.  Others that are very good include 'What The World Needs', 'Every Man', and 'Slow Fade'.\n\nI would highly recommend this to anyone who is already a fan of Casting Crowns.

                "Details is a mildly interesting magazine that is geared toward men of various ages and lifestyles. The main group that Details aims to capture is the 17 to 35 year- old male but there are articles in each magazine that could be appealing to men of many different ages, mostly in the middle to upper income groups.\n\nSome things about Details quickly set it apart from other magazines. One difference is the \"departments\". Most magazines have departments, but instead of talking about the same things each month, these departments vary in their content (the only exceptions being \"Know- Tell\" and the \"The Details\"). Each one contains similar stories from one month to the next, but with different subtitles, helping to make each issue a little fresher than it would otherwise be.\n\nAs far as the writing goes, Details offers a great deal of diversity for a magazine. Yes, it is generally focused on things of interest to men, but it covers a very broad range of interests. You can find articles in this magazine on such diverse topics as the death penalty, raising kids, buying a new coat, setting up an internet business, breaking up with a girlfriend, or purchasing the best vodka. There are articles geared toward single men and married men, as well as younger men and middle- aged men.\n\nI like some of the articles found here but there is one problem I have with the writing in Details. It is common to find eye- catching headlines on the cover of Details that tempt you to find out more. This is nothing new and most every magazine does this. But the problem is that many of these eye- popping stories fail to keep you amazed when you read them. Take for example an article in a recent issue. On the front, it reads \"Is Your Wife a Bad Mom\"? It sound like an engaging, intellectual read. But once you find the article and take in its 1,000+ words, you quickly discover that there is little or no substance. Basically, it simply tells men that accusing your wife of being a bad mom is a risky undertaking that could hurt her feelings. That is it. There is no intellectual analysis or quotes from studies; only the bottom line conclusion that mothers generally don't like to be called incompetent by their husbands. Other headlining articles in this magazine lead to similar disappointment.\n\nThe writing in this magazine is on the edge and very blunt. It is common to find several four- letter words in many of the articles and while this doesn't bother me at all, I know that some readers will consider it too raw, too edgy, and too explicit. Details writers have no problem telling it like it is, and this can be both good and bad depending on one's perspective.\n\nBesides the language, some parts of this magazine could offend certain readers; namely the \"Anthropology\" page at the end. This closing \"article\" is meant to be humorous, but some readers will not see it that way. I don't know if it has always been this way, but what \"Anthropology\" does is show a person or multiple people and then asks the question \"Gay or ______\". For example, I have seen titles like \"Gay or Best Friends?\", \"Gay or Cowboy?\", \"Gay or Neo Punk Rocker?\", and others. With each of these, there is a diagram of sorts with arrows pointing to different clothing and bodily features and short comments about each one. Basically, it is asking you to think about these different attributes of the person or people in the picture and then decide if the way they dress, look, and act makes them gay. I find this silly and immature, but I can see how some readers would find it insulting. I don't know if Details has always done this or if the Anthropology page has been different in the past. But this is how it has been in every issue I have read and it needs to be changed.\n\nAdvertisements claim about sixty percent of the pages in each issue of this magazine. They cover products like liquor, cars, electronics, cigarettes, fragrance, etc. Even though this magazine covers lots of different things, the item most often featured in the advertisements is clothing. The magazine seems to have a penchant for high fashion and it devotes more pages to expensive clothing than anything else. And each issue often has its own unique smell, thanks to all of the cologne samples. You can flip through the pages and find several samples in each issue, with many of the latest and trendiest scents from the biggest names in cologne.\n\nOverall, I am torn between liking or not liking Details Magazine. I like some of the articles on food, drink, politics and the like. But I don't necessarily like the shallow fluff that is often substituted for an intellectual discussion and I can understand how some readers would find certain aspects of this magazine insulting. This magazine is deserving of only about two and one- half stars which I will round up to three stars and give a small recommendation. Some will like this magazine and some will not. It's all a matter of what you like to read about and whether or not you can handle a magazine that pushes the envelope.",
                "Gorilla Glue eight ounce size.\nMost of us have been in a home repair situation that just keeps getting worse the more you get into it. When that happens worse means more cash to fix the problem. There are those who say just \"do it right\" or don't do it at all. You know who you are. I can agree with them, when there is money to use, but when there are no funds there is..... Gorilla Glue. Well here is my story.\n\nI had a small problem that quickly spiraled into a carpenters truck payments. I had a loose toilet. Not a big deal right. Tried to usual tighter down the loose bolts. No help they just kept turning, which means the terrible and dreaded WOOOOOD ROTTTTTT.\nYes Houston we have a problem. The tiolet flange that holds it in place was rotten from some sneaky water leak somewhere not visible. This insidious leak had taken its toll and caused great damage under the bathroom tile.\n\nIn comes repair guy 1 then second opinion guy. Remedy; You gotta take that toilet out, bust out all that floor tile, cut out the sub floor, put in new sub floor, put in new tile, new toilet flange, and re set toilet then grout everything. Estimate to \"Do It Right\" nearly two grand. Since you have a carpenter, then a tile guy, then a plumber guy. My heart sank as I knew how much cash I had at the time.\n\nMy thoughts. The floor seemed good everywhere but around the flange. The toilet while it would turn and lift on one side was still holding fair on one side. If only I could just shoer this thing up where it would be stable. I wish I could just shoot something in there that would fix everything and not go in debt.\n\nHow about Gorilla Glue. No that would just make a bigger mess. No here me out this might work. No it won't Gorilla Glue expands and will screw up everything. All this was the conversation i was having with myself in my head.\n\nOk lets do this but how to get it under the toilet. I took the bottle of glue and went to the hose department at home depot and found some clear plastic hose that would fit on the end.\n\nThe process. I lifted up one side of the toilet to inspect wood damage and condition. The rot was in the past and little moisture was present so the leak may have been partly condensation gone wild. Good news. Gorilla Glue activates with moisture. Didn't know that, so the conditions here are perfect. What the glue was now to do is to bond with the bad wood becoming super strong, water resistant, and hard as stone. it will make a bridge so to speak with the bad wood and the good wood, and Gorilla will bond with porcelain like grout does but stronger bond.\n\nThe attack. Hose on bottle, one side of toilet is lifted, hose inserted, squeezing and not much is happening as this glue is thick. Plan B, set glue bottle on floor use foot pressure. Eureka we have glue flow. Pumped about two ounces all around the toilet. Luckily the high pressure from my foot did not make the hose come off and get all over my shoes and the outside of the toilet.\n\nOk ok you knew it was going to happen. Yes the hose did come off and glue spewed all over my shoes and toilet. Cleaned it off and we are done almost. Remember the glue does expand while it dries filling up gaps as it forms it bonds. I was ready with a box cutter coming back in every ten minutes to inspect and trim.\n\nAll in all it worked. Solid as a rock. No leaks. Used some white silicone caulk around the base. The choice was either eight bucks for the glue, or nearly two grand that could better be used for other things like beer, new flat screen tv, taking the wife out to dinner sixty times, or other electronic man toys.\n\nThis glue saved me. In life you come across small things that work their way your heart for how well they help you or serve a purpose. Your uses and millage of course may vary. Good luck always.",

                "There are over 100 video lessons here. Most users have given this a high rating and I assume they are very comfortable with video learning. Personally I found it rather tedious.\n\nI'd like to learn Lightroom because I've owned it for a while. I tried to use it but did not understand it so I went back to using Adobe Bridge, which is think is generally under-appreciated. I love Photoshop but tend to spend a lot of time with it, so the supposed time-saving features of Lightroom would be helpful.\n\nI really hoped this product would make it easy for me to use Lightroom. Unfortunately I had trouble staying alert through more than 3 or 4 lessons at a time, and that much only covers a small portion of the material.  I don't think this is because of the presenters so much as it is the difficulty of covering this sort of material in a video format.\n\nThe Introduction alone consists of 26 videos. It seemed like a commercial for Lightroom rather than a tutorial. Seven of the lessons are devoted to \"What's New\" -- not too relevant for beginners. On the plus side, there were plenty of screen shots to familiarize us with the look of the software.\n\nUnit 2 has 11 video lessons on importing pictures. That gives you an idea on how much detail is here. If that's what you need, you'll find this product useful.",

I wanted to use this to update a new will, since my old one is about ten years old, but ended up just typing the new one in because my old form is much better for where I live.  If, however, you don't want to hire a lawyer and you don't know how to pull together every form you might need for end of life legal dispositions (will, health care directive, etc.) and you don't have a big or complicated life, this will do the trick nicely and save you a lot of money.  If there is anything complicated in your dispositions or instructions, I would recommend paying for an attorney.

I'm moving ahead slowly with this system and have started playing the songs in the course and this success has created within me a desire to continue. We also have one for my left-handed son (7) and his left-handed guitar. He is learning right along side me. We are really enjoying doing this together. The Chord Buddy has made this easy and affordable. Once we complete the course the plan is to move on to more lessons so this isn't the end-all but it is the best way I've seen to get started.

                "Christian soft rock group Casting Crowns has taken the Christian music world by storm thanks to two strong previous releases.  And their third project should continue the trend.\n\nThe group has captured audiences with challenging lyrics and great music.  There's nothing earth shattering with either, but both work together to create some great music.\n\nThe disc starts off with the rock anthem \"What This World Needs.\"  Think \"If We are the Body\" but faster.  The song reminds us that the world needs Christ more then it needs 100% perfect outward appearances.  After all, the heart is what counts.\n\nThe title of the album comes from the idea that somewhere between hearing what we should do during church (the altar) and driving away (the door), we loose the certainty and conviction we had.  I'll just say been there, done that.  That theme is explored in two songs.  The first is the title track, which really explains the theme better then I ever could.  And it's rather convicting to hear my struggle put into words.  The second is the next track, \"Somewhere in the Middle.\"  In fact, the phrase \"between the altar and the door\" shows up in this song, too.  The song is a challenge to get out of the luke warm world we too often live in.\n\nAs with other Casting Crown's CDs, this one features a couple worship songs.  And, once again, they don't grab me.  There's nothing wrong with \"I Know You're There\" and \"All Because of Jesus,\" but they aren't as special as some of their other tracks.\n\nMy two favorite songs are back to back.  \"Slow Fade\" is a challenge to all men to not fall away from the faith.  It really drives home the importance of constantly standing guard because no one crumbles in a day.  It's a slower song with a haunting sound.  And it ends with lead singer Mark Hall's daughter singing \"Because Little Eyes.\"  It's enough to give me chills.\n\nAppropriately enough, the next song is \"East to West.\"  As you might guess, this song talks about forgiveness.  It explores the difficulty we have in accepting God's forgiveness and the weight of shame we try to live under.  As with so many of their songs, the lyrics are powerful.\n\nMusically, there are few surprises here for the long time fan.  But that's just fine because their music is wonderful.\n\nI'm surprised I haven't worn out Casting Crown's first two releases I've listened to them so often.  This one will certainly suffer the same fate.",

Since I can't see what the price is for the subscription on here, I cant tell if you're paying the same amount on here for the no CD sub, as you would with the CD. CD sub. price is $29.95. You can obviously look at the top of the page, and see what the price is.

                "We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer.  I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.  A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.",

First in 2003, we get the Number Ones album, then in 2004 we get the Ultimate Box Set Edition,& now this. Don't get me wrong, I love Michael Jackson but why no new material on this album. The first Disc starts off great, the only missing from that one is songs like the Jackson 5's I'll Be There,Lovely One,Heartbreak Hotel,Never Can Say Goodbye and a few more.

The annual subscription to Office 365 Home Premium became a worthy option for a new PC running Windows 8 as a development\/test system for both hardware and software, so when it came to making a decision as to which suite to go with, curiosity won out.\n\nHere are the highly-subjective likes and dislikes found so far with this installation of the new Office 365 Home Premium suite for those looking for just the key points, then followed with some expanded details.\n\n Likes:\n\n+ Very smooth installation; simple directions, easy to follow, almost effortless\n+ Clean interface; smooth and minimalist, ribbon can be collapsed as needed\n+ Operates on five PCs or Macs; license for single household with multiple users\n+ Excellent Outlook integration; works well with Outlook.com, Gmail and private email\n+ SkyDrive; allows for access of files on the cloud, file sharing when needed\n+ Easy customization once installed; make it work your way\n\n Rants & Irritants:\n\n- Full ALL CAPS menu tabs; don't like having the Metro-style jammed down my throat\n\n Installation:\n\nThe setup is simple and easy to follow. Included in the small box are the directions and a 25-character Product Key card. Go to the Microsoft Office site as indicated, enter the characters from the card as noted, then sign into or create your Microsoft account. Users who already have an Outlook account (possibly converted over from Hotmail) can start with that. Then it's a simple scenario of following the on-screen directions, and the entire installation should be finished in under 30 minutes.\n\nFound the interface to be much cleaner than my older Office 2007 running on another older computer, and with the exception of the CAPS ON menu tabs noted above, it was a good improvement. Though I did not do any precise stopwatch timings, Office 365 seemed to load faster and smoother. The ribbon menu can be collapsed or expanded as needed. When you open up Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Publisher, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document, which is just an extra click away.\n\nWhat follows are some subjective notes about the various components found within this Office 365 Home Premium suite. I won't attempt to go too heavy into each of these as one could write a full review on most of the modules by themselves, but consider these as observations found from a few weeks use.\n\n SkyDrive:\n\nI like SkyDrive and have been using it for some time. This has been integrated quite well within Office 365 Home Premium, and has built in resilience against jittery Internet connections. Should you should lose your connectivity while working on a file opened from a SkyDrive account, Office 365 saves it temporarily on your local hard drive before synchronizing with SkyDrive at a later point in time. And what is good is that it syncs quite well so that you can retrieve\/edit documents (or images) from other computers once you're logged in.\n\n Word:\n\nThe features for Word have remained largely the same as those in Office 2007 and those that I've found working on clients' Office 2010 installations. Documents often need to be edited after they are written, and Word 2013 makes the editing process easier with such new features such as the ability to edit PDF files. Previously, you needed to install third-party software, such as Adobe Acrobat. This was available to those of us who have been running Word for Mac 2011 where it does a respectable job, but is new to the PC version. Have not had much time to play with it, but if it works as well as the Mac version, then this will be a big help.\n\nAmong the new additions that I've found are that you can watch embedded videos right there within the document, and without having to go to a different application. If you work with collaborative documents, you can reply within comments and those replies will be displayed in threaded conversation style.\n\n Excel:\n\nOn a personal note, I have had a love\/hate relationship with spreadsheet programs in general since the days of Microsoft Multiplan and Lotus 1-2-3, both of which are distant history now. That being said, Excel has been a program of choice for years now, and one that I've used to input table data into Word and as a flat file database for quite some time. Entering data into spreadsheets can be a tedious and boring chore, so the downward fill feature in Excel that allows you automatically fill the cells in each row with the same number by dragging down has been an ally.\n\nBut now there's a new Flash Fill feature that recognizes patterns in your data functions, then automatically fills in the rest of the spreadsheet, and complex formulas are not necessary. You can make it automatically format names the same way (such as last, first, middle initial) just by giving it some examples. Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, such as (212) 555-1212, and restore the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze. Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it. It's well worth it.\n\n OneNote:\n\nThis is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated components of the Office suites. First encountered it in Office 2007, and it became a handy way to keep simple notes and such, but it was limited. The new version will allow you to embed Excel spreadsheets and see the preview within your note. When you update the spreadsheet, the preview automatically updates, as well. Searching within OneNote is better, as you can now search for words that are embedded in graphics files.\n\n PowerPoint:\n\nThere's a new, cleaner look to PowerPoint. You can start a new presentation using a theme, a template, an older presentation or a more recent one, as well as a blank one. New users should find PowerPoint 2013 to be more intuitive than older versions, and those who are experienced PowerPoint pros will find that everything seems to go smoother. I pulled up some old presentations, including one that was from the late 1990s, and found that doing a few edits was a very smooth process. The themes now come with variations, so tightening up on the look you want is simpler.\n\n Outlook:\n\nThere's an openness to this upgraded version. Outlook is a powerful module, but it will take new users a bit of time to learn to navigate among all of the functions and to understand the numerous toolbar icons, as I found out when showing mine to a colleague. I've been using Outlook under Office for Mac 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and never had an issue with Outlook on the OS X platform. I'm currently trying to sync the two versions as much as possible.\n\n Publisher:\n\nI personally use Publisher infrequently at this point. Like the other modules in Office 365, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document.\n\n Access:\n\nThe Office Access relational database management system was a product that at one time was a favorite when I was converting over from dBase III many years ago. Speaking honestly, I have not accessed this module, and pardon the pun.\n\n Annoyances & Irritants:\n\nMy primary gripe with the new Office suites has to do with the full ALL CAPS menu tabs, and I'm trying my best to see if I can learn to adapt or if I'll change it. As noted earlier, I don't like the \"new\" Microsoft Metro style being jammed down my throat without the option to change it easily. It's essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web. There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon. Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK. When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized. You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them.\n\n Suggestions:\n\nPutting this simply, if you're happy with Office 2007 or 2010, you may want to weigh your choices between the various versions here, read some of the reviews that best apply to your own needs, then decide whether you wish to keep the earlier version or go for the upgrade. My decision to try Office 365 was based on the fact that it was going to be a 'clean' install on a new Windows 8 PC and that I had a year to use it and see if it was worth the subscription, or if it might be better to go with a 'regular' license for another version. My installation went smoothly and it works well; your results may differ from mine.\n\nI have not tried an installation on a Windows 7 PC to date, but have been largely impressed with how well it runs on a standard, out-of-the-box Windows 8 PC. Please note: this review will be dynamic in that as I find experiences worth sharing, be they pro or con, they will be appended to this review. Other findings or additional resources may be listed in the comments.\n\n Summary:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Office-365-Home-Premium\/dp\/B009SPTUW2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Office 365 Home Premium<\/a>&nbsp;as a one year subscription for five users\/computers has proven to be an interesting choice for my needs as noted in this review. Please keep in mind that with such a program, your needs and mine may differ, as we each use such office suites in different fashions. Currently I'll rate this suite at a solid 4-star product that can be recommended on the Windows 8 platform.\n\n9\/30\/2013",

It took me less than 30 minutes to install the software (Windows 7, install went smoothly) and create a basic will that met my needs.  And of course if things ever change I can easily modify the will.  There are a lot of more options that I didn't try yet because I don't need them.  But should the need arise, it's nice to know those additional features are there."

                "I am a intermediate player. I know these chords. I am getting older and my hands getting slower. So I bought this to use to save a little on my tired hands. I can play many many songs with just these few simple chords and that is why I purchased it and I was hoping my child would see the ease and give it a try, I hope they do. this is a good learning tool for novice players that allow them to play songs in just a few moments, something very few systems do. Many get fustrated tring to play, this item takes away allot of that fustration in learning hand positions and allows them to play a song immediately. Great product for the novice, and the intermediate player and some older players with age may find this simple solution of tired hands easy to compensate for that problem and still play.( one thing I must mention, do not let this be a crutch for learning the correct chords and finger positions. It is so easy it will distract that fact from your learning and make it easy to push one button instead of learning the fingering and you will rely on it to much,Please learn from it and don't rely on it all the time) Still a great product and will indeed help you to learn the finger positions one chord at a time.",
                "This is a decent starter package for what it is:\n\n1. A Firebrand wood soprano ukulele with nylon strings. (More on this)\n2. A copy of Alfred's Teach Yourself to Play Ukulele with a CD\n3. Extra strings\n4. A \"gig\" bag.\n\nThe uke is laminated wood and  mediocre. The strings are average in quality. The book is fine, though I prefer&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Play-Ukulele-Today\/dp\/0634078615\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Play Ukulele Today!<\/a>&nbsp;for the rank beginner (it teaches the notes on the strings) and if you are somewhat familiar, then I prefer&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Ukulele-for-Dummies\/dp\/047097799X\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ukulele for Dummies<\/a>&nbsp;which has a lot on not only playing, but strumming, picking, styles and has a CD and many types of songs to learn.\n\nAs to the uke, believe it or not, a plastic-and-laminate&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Makala-Dolphin\/dp\/B0037CMDE4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Makala Dolphin<\/a>&nbsp;though it looks like a toy, is an excellent instrument and when set up with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Aquila-Strings\/dp\/B003NJF1G8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Aquila Strings<\/a>&nbsp;sounds amazing. Many \"pro\" ukulele players and those who are advanced and own instruments that cost into the thousands, own a Dolphin and play it with pleasure. It comes in a myriad of colors, so if you are looking for something battle-solid, funky and kid-friendly, the Dolphin with Aquila strings has it all.\n\nIf you want to save money, this still is a good deal, but I suggest you change the strings to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Aquila-Strings\/dp\/B003NJF1G8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Aquila Strings<\/a>&nbsp;no matter what spare strings come with it. This is a soprano, by the way, so when buying strings, that's the size to look for. Aquilas are made of a nylon that makes a loud, rich sound and they are known for bringing out the sound of even poorer quality instruments. And you need a tuner--the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Snark-Tuner\/dp\/B003VWKPHC\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Snark Tuner<\/a>is not expensive and can be used on other types of instruments as well (guitar, etc.)\n\nThis was a good deal at under thirty simoleons, but if you are really serious to learn uke or want your kids to learn, the setup I mentioned may keep them interested longer. The quality of strings and the quality of a cheap uke can be optimized to the point where it's more than barely playable, and one mistake people make when taking up a musical instrument is to buy one that is so inexpensive, that it frustrates the learner. I have had this happen with the flute and the guitar. It really makes a difference what you learn on, and you have to balance the desire not to invest too much at first with the fact that too cheap a setup will just lead to failure.\n\nFor the record, I own a red Dolphin. I played uke as a kid and was able to pick up the instrument after 50 years of not playing, learn fingerstyle (picking) and enjoy playing it until I got a more serious instrument that indeed plays more sweetly. But I actually play the Dolphin quite a lot and enjoy its sound.\n\nThe setup I propose here will do you better as an adult, and will suit a child as well. You'll spend about twice as much but your chances for success are, in my opinion, a lot better. There are some excellent sites to visit to get free advice and to subscribe to video lessons (ukulele underground is my favorite.) Check out what I say and see if others don't agree with me. At the very least, if you opt for this package, get the better strings and the tuner. I guarantee you will be happier.",

                "first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a \"construction\" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it.\n\nso whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush...\n\nanother minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector.\n\nwith all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!",

This book appeals to me immensely as I love the heavy Asian art and Art Nouveau influences  The coloring of her projects feel both soft and strong, and I love her patterns.  I like this book as her designs are substantially fine art creations.  The designs are rich yet bold with patterns that are unique.  Techniques are well demonstrated through both pictures and clear instructions.  This is not quite for the novice as it assumes that you know the basic polymer clay techniques.

That means 120 years of one of the world's most amazing magazines, all digitized and capable of being loaded onto your computer.\n\nThe nice part about this collection is that every issue of the magazine is reproduced as exactly as possible (barring some \"printing\" errors here and there):  every page, complete with ads, and all photos vividly reproduced, representing over 50GB of material.\n\nThe bad part is that every issue of this magazine is reproduced exactly:  they are issues that you flip through, page by page, with a Table of Contents.  The interface takes some getting used to, and the search engine leaves a bit to be desired.  The program can also be a little slow to respond, particularly when it first loads.  Drilling down to specifics is not as easy as idly thumbing through issues, and thumbing through issues can also be a bit tedious.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that the National Geographic Society are not Wikipedia:  information presented here was the well researched and chronicled *at the time of printing*--older issues will not be brought up to date with the world's latest discoveries.  This collection exists simply as a way to see the massive collection of the National Geographic Society that spans over a century of traveling the world and absorbing its information.

                "I finally decided to add 'The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0' set to my collection, and it's almost perfect. Unlike the original release, this one comes in a digipak fold out case, which hold the 3 CDs in slits and can be a problem if you handle them often, so plan on uploading the music to iTunes (etc) to avoid scratching your discs. The digipak case unfolds to reveal cool photos of Michael, and you also get a nice booklet that provides more photos, plus complete details (chart info, etc) for each song. As for the music, this collection does a nice job representing BOTH the Motown & Epic years for Michael (and his Brothers on Disc 1). The first 2 CDs are jam packed with a total of 38 songs, many of which are featured as 'single edits', which is fine as I already have the full versions. The Bonus 3rd Disc is a nice treat, but could've been perfect if 'I'll Be There', 'Dancing Machine', and 'Scream' (Duet with Janet) were included. It does however feature Michael's #1 duet with Paul McCartney ('Say, Say, Say'), which has never appeared on a Jackson CD until now. At any rate, I recommend this affordable 3 CD set to fans who want a better Michael Jackson collection than 'Number Ones' or aren't ready to purchase the 'Ultimate Collection' (which also failed to include a number of classics!).",

Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now.

That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.\nI noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.  Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.  I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.  A little price to pay for a clean vent.",
                "I got this version instead of the PS3 version, which turned out to be a mistake. Console versions of games look 95 percent as good as their PC versions, but you do not have to deal with driver issues and the numerous things that can go wrong with windows. First off the installation takes about 30 minutes, which is ridiculous. I have never had a game take this long to load, Shift 2 took about 20 minutes which seemed too long also. Next many of the latest games for PC are forcing you to have an internet connection in order to install the game, regardless of whether you want to play only offline single player games. Shift 2 unleashed is also like this, so be forewarned. Internet requirements are not prominently displayed on the boxes. The game pushes you, but does not require you to, sign up for a Games For Windows Live account, which is required to get the game patches and updates. More time wasted signing up for that. Finally after about one hour the game was up and running , but the menu screen text had red blocky borders, and the sun in the game screens was ugly pink red, with red reflections on the car and everywhere. So more time spent googling to find a solution to this. I had to download a hot-fix driver update for my AMD videocard driver, which solved that red text and sun problem. Finally after nearly 2 hours I was able to play the game, which is perhaps the prettiest racing game I have ever played. Magnificent graphics, and fun excellent gameplay. Good forcefeedback effects with a steering wheel, and excellent sense of speed and immersion, makes this a top notch sim racer with just a hint of arcade feeling to it.\nI was really, finally enjoying the game , when suddenly about 30 minutes in to a race the game suddenly crashed. No error message or anything, it just hung up and crashed to desktop, under windows 7. I later tried it with Windows XP on the same machine, and it crashed less frequently, usually only when exiting the game, but random crashes really kill the fun of a racing game, since it might not crash during an entire 20 lap race or it might crash on the 2nd lap.\nIt is a great game when it works, and if you are lucky enough to have a machine that it runs stably on then by all means get this game. But hang on to your receipt just in case.\nI am tired of fiddling with my computer trying to find a totally reliable setup for this game, so I think I am going to buy a copy for my PS3, which has never crashed, in over 3 years of game playing. I have been buying the top notch PC versions of videogames and spent thousands of dollars over the years on faster videocards and cpu's , but I have finally grown tired of fiddling with incompatibilities of hardware and software, and now game publishers demanding that you have an internet connection as well as providing a long serial number, utilizing gigabytes of harddrive space, 30 minute or longer installation times ( it takes less time to install Windows 7 ) , and requiring you to sign up for their online service and game store, and still you have to put that stupid little DVD in your computer everytime you want to play a simple game to relax. I am pretty much done with PC gaming, since the consoles are so much less hassle, and they have \" good enough \" graphics that the diminishing returns of costly higher resolution better antialiased higher framerate graphics is not worth it. When the PS4 and Xbox 720 come out, I think the law of diminishing returns will be even more evident.",

Hylian crest and gold embellishments around the borders, different color for each game, titles on spine. They simply look amazing. The chest box is pretty cool too, but I'm not as impressed with it since I generally prefer to display books in the traditional upright position on a bookshelf. But it's a great tie-in to the games since opening chests is always something you associate with Zelda games.\n\nMy only regrets are paying extremely high prices for individual new\/sealed guides a year ago before this set was announced. I paid closer to $200 to get them all brand new on eBay. This set will surely devalue my existing ones since I'm planning on now reselling them. But I had to get this set since it included the OoT 3D guide that you can't get separately.\n\nI really don't get why they would release this set so close to the guide for A Link Between Worlds. Did no one have the foresight to either include a blank spot for the new guide, or actually include the new guide in this set? In a way it makes the set feel instantly out of date right at release. But oh well, not that big of a deal. I will be purchasing that one separately before it also becomes sold out everywhere and triples in price like Twilight Princess did.",

The shipping boxes are not the most protective.  There is no foam inside the box just a piece of cardboard on top and bottom.  Hence, both grills had dents in them from shipping.  Fortunately, I was able to tap them out but they are not perfect and should be when bought new.\n\nThe other issue is that one of the fans comes on very quickly and is considerably louder than the other fan.  The QSC tech said it was normal because the speakers were meant to be used in a loud environment and fan noise was given no consideration.  I don't buy it since the other speaker's fan is much quieter.\n\nStill I think the speakers are a good buy.",
                "I remember the first time I heard Casting Crowns on the radio several years ago. It wasn't Mark Hall's voice, the band's music, or even the harmonies sung that drew me in. It was the lyrics. I was going through a situation that \"Voice of Truth\" so eloquently and accurately addressed. I honestly felt the Lord meant for me to hear that song at that particular time. I decided to go ahead and buy that album and found every song spoke volumes to me. Now here we are 3 albums later and once again, Mark and his amazing ensemble of musicians have done it again. They have put together an album that speaks volumes to my heart.\n\nI really like the way that Casting Crowns' albums generally have a theme. This album is no exception. I find the theme throughout this album is about staying in our comfort zone also known as the middle ground- the safety zone. But he also addresses the middle as in the 'gray area' which we all have to deal with on a daily basis no doubt. Mark sings about how we all have good intentions but when it comes to stepping out of our comfort zone for God we say...'no way!'. We give God a list that says I'll do this and this but there is no way I can or will do that or that. Fear is usually the biggest reason most of us don't step out of our comfort zone. I am in no way pointing a finger because I find I am probably the guiltiest of all at doing this. That said, this album truly helps me to understand why I do what I do and how to remedy it. It inspires me to seek out the Lord in His Word and in prayer and meditation.\n\nThe first song on the album: \"What This World Needs\" is a great way to start off the album. It has a rocky edge that draws you in to its chorus and before you know it you are singing along. I actually had to listen to this song several times before I could fully appreciate what Mark was trying to say.\n\nSong #2: Every Man- This song references the fact that no matter who we are or what we've done there is Hope for us. Hope comes in the form of Jesus Who knows how we feel and can understand what we are going through.\n\n#3: Slow Fade- This is an amazing song that helps us realize that no one goes from being on fire for the Lord to dabbling with sin in one day. No, instead it is a slow fade. Satan knows the best attack is a gradual attack which makes black and white fade into gray.\n\n#4: East to West- One of my favorites on this album. This is one of the songs on this album that speaks to me personally. It is with songs like this that I wonder if maybe God isn't giving Mark a look into my heart. (As if I'm the only one struggling with issues like this. ;-) )\n\n#5: The Word Is Alive- As the title indicates, this song is about the Bible and how It brings forth hope to the hopeless and frail.\n\n#6: The Altar and the Door- One of my favorites also. \"The Altar and the Door\" musically has a lot to offer. It is very upbeat and easy to sing along with. This song is one of the many that teaches about how we get caught in the middle and lose our follow through between the altar and the door. I believe we all are guilty of this at some point in our walk with the Lord.\n\n#7: Somewhere in the Middle- This is my absolute favorite song on the album for several reasons. One of which is that this song is easy to sing along with and secondly, because it is such a deep song that carries a great amount of meaning. I really think it should be my \"anthem\". I admire Mark's clever word play- \"Fearless warriors on a picket fence, Reckless abandon wrapped in common sense, deep-water faith in the shallow end, We are caught in the middle with eyes wide open to the differences, The God we want and the God who is...\" What Mark illustrates here is how contrary and fickle we as the body of Christ can be. We know right from wrong and we know how to discern truth from fiction, but yet we stay in the middle ground where it is safe and easy instead of standing up for what is right...which reminds me of the great story of the three young men thrown into the fiery furnace.\n\n#8: I Know You're There: This song is great! One of the ladies from Casting Crowns sings this. She does a terrific job and is able to carry her own without any problem. This song is about knowing that God is always there for us.\n\n#9: Prayer for a Friend: This song, which sounds close to a ballad, is about those we are closest to getting caught up in the world and we want nothing more than to bring them back to the Lord.\n\n#10: All Because of Jesus: This is a praise and worship song that I think will one day be sung in churches all over the world.\n\n#11: White Dove: This song is completely different from anything Casting Crowns has ever done. I am not a big fan of it though I have to applaud them for trying something different.\n\nI highly recommend this album to anyone who worships with music. I also recommend it to anyone who is feeling lost in this big world. Casting Crowns does a great job of helping its listener connect (or re-connect) with God.\n\nOne more note: This album is GREAT to work out with!!! I do my strength training and cardio workouts with this album. I also like jogging to this album.",

                "I have gotten ripped on previously Casting Crowns reviews because I gave them 4 stars instead of 5...so there is no doubt people will go crazy with this review.  But with that being said, this CD just wasn't very good.  Once again Casting Crowns does what it does best - write songs pointing the finger at the church.  Yes, it was a good song with \"If We Are The Body\" and \"Does Anybody Hear Her,\" but with \"What This World Needs,\" it's just gotten old now.  It starts to become annoying when a band harps on one point, especially one that is as generalizing as saying the church isn't doing what it is supposed to.  Move on to another topic!!!\n\nThis CD also lacks the catchiness of the last 2 albums.  And where the last 2 CD's had a solid 6 or 7 songs on them, this album has 2 at most.  I just couldn't get into any of the songs.  Musically, it is average and the lyrics are not up to par.  Looking forward to the new David Crowder Band album, though, which will surely not disappoint.  Hope Casting Crowns pulls it together for its next album.  This one will sell a lot of units, but will not stand the test of time.  It will collect dust on my shelf.",

Record was dead flat (as in free of warps) drilled dead center, poly lined paper sleeve, lyrics sheet, download card. Before playing The record was cleaned with A.I. #6 via KABUSA EV-1. Very quiet background and dead silent between tracks, generous lead-in area and dead wax, I think the overall time is just a hair over 47:00.\n\nIt may be the most quiet metal record I own as far as background, and darn sure is the best for $18.99 or less. The record volume overall is a tad low but nothing that's not easily overcome by the volume control. I was impressed to the point that I will now seek out the new releases of Kill em All and Puppets, despite Puppets having some issues according to reviews.\n\nSo yeah, mix sounds nice and balanced, good bass, vocals recessed a tad, but not a big deal IMO.

The subscription model will force Microsoft to stay ahead of the curve constantly trying to win its own customers to renew and not being able to rest on its laurels.  And the quality of the software and syncing interface makes me willing to pay for this.\n\nFinally, at this time through the Bing search engine you are able to get 100 GB of free One Drive space which has made it so I can keep all of my documents in the cloud, accessible and synced across all devices.

Examples: under Estate Planning, the documents include Will, Health Care Directive (Living Will & Power of Attorney), Durable Power of Attorney for Finances, etc. Under Home and Family, there's Child Care Agreement, Pet Care Agreement, Elder Care Agreement, Housesitting instructions, etc.  This program guides users using a simple questions and answers format by clicking on or entering relevant info.  I hammered out a rudimentary yet legal will and printed it in less than five minutes.  Overall: perhaps a bit oversimplified but sometimes simplicity makes the entire legal process easier to understand and execute for most users.  Users requiring more detailed\/complicated legal documents can reference Nolo's online resources or seek professional legal counsel."

                "This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System\n\nWeve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall.\n\nWe knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer.\n\nI had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3\/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!",
                "great deal for my office",

                "Even though glo was the winner of the 2010 ECPA Bible of the Year award, the software was a bit buggy and there were many complaints, all of which have been addressed.  After a seamless, but lengthy installation (there is a tremendous amount of information being loaded) it didn't take me long to realize that glo was good to go.  The only minor glitch was that I had to install Roxio first.  If you've never installed a program you may need a bit of guidance, but for anyone else installation is quite simple.  Glo seriously listened to the user of the last version.\n\nThings glo has improved upon:\n\n++ They now have a help system that is both in and outside the program.  There are \"lenses\" that \"distribute content over a zoomable interface,\" media containers, a result's grid, basic and advanced searches, menus, and a link to online tutorials.  All of these are explained in the help menu with visuals to assist the user.\n\n++  Glo has added online tutorials for those who would like an overview prior to either purchasing or using the software.\n\n++  The user can check out the \"contributors and sources\" on the company website.  I did notice that when I clicked on information on Syria I was taken to an Wikipedia article on the web.\n\n++  There is a \"Quick Install\" option (I didn't opt to use this one) and an uninstall option on your control panel.\n\n++  When you start glo up it will immediately look for updates, something that most people will appreciate as it will keep your information from becoming dated or obsolete.\n\n++ You can install glo on five personal devices,including PC, Mac, iPhone and iPad.\n\nThe only thing I didn't find was a user manual, something that I would have appreciated as would many other users.  Sometimes a user manual is greatly appreciated by those who are a little less high tech.  I can't fault glo as they are selling software and not manuals, but it would have been a nice touch.  With all the nice additions, I'll give a little bit of information on what you are getting.  If you already know you want this software, you can simply bypass the rest of this review.  In this \"revolutionary new Bible\" (NIV study Bible) you'll find an an amazing array of all aspects of Biblical lore from the historical aspects, to spirituality, the arts, and many more factual aspects you can weave into your own life and studies.\n\nGLO features:\n\n++  450+ Virtual Tours\n  These are 360-degree tours of \"modern-day and re-created\" ancient biblical locations.\"\n\n++  3.5 Hours of HD Videos\n  You'll be able to enjoy the \"In His Shoes\" HD interactive documentary.\n\n++  2,300+ High Resolution Photos\n  The zoom feature is a real plus when you want to look more closely at a photograph.\n\n++  7,500+ Articles\n  The large variety of articles will help you as you create your own Bible reading plan\n\nTake for example when I wanted to take a look at Syria.  There was a columnar format that presented the information GLO had to offer provided I wanted to explore its relation to the Bible in my readings.  I was offered thirty-three scripture references, one internal article, twelve maps, and one web article.\n\n++  650+ Works of Art\n\n++  Integration with the best web content\n\n++  Continual additions to the content each time you load the program\n\n++  Concise, compact organization through five \"lenses\"\n\n++  You have the ability to journal and take notes as you study\n\nLENSES:\n\nBIBLE:  You can easily navigate and find the verse or chapter you want easily.\n\nTIMELINE:  You can compare and contrast when many events occurred through time starting with the Creation\n\nMyGlo:  This is where you will house all your notes, journal, bookmarks, and \"reading plans.\"\n\nMEDIA:  This area houses the videos, thousands of articles, photographs, artwork, maps, virtual tours, and more.\n\nATLAS:  This is a zoomable atlas where you can see the larger \"picture\" or zoom in to see a particular area of interest.\n\nTOPICAL:  Here you can \"quickly find relevant verses and articles on thousands of key concepts.\"\n\nThere are three DVDs in this packet.  You can now install it on both Windows and Mac systems.  Below are the system requirements.\n\nPC System Requirements:\n\nMicrosoft Windows XP, Vista, or Windows 7 operating system with latest service pack installed\n\nDuel core processor\n\n1GB RAM for Microsoft Windows XP, or 2GB RAM for Vista or Window 7\n\nAt lease 1GB of free hard disk space, 18GB for full media install\n\nVideo card with Microsoft DirectX 9 support\n\nInternet Connection\n\nDVD-ROM drive\n\nMac System Requirements\n\nIntel-Based Mac\n\nMac OS 10.5.8 (Leopard) or higher\n\n2GB RAM\n\nAt least 200MB of free hard disk space, 18 GB for full media install\n\nInternet Connection\n\nDVD-ROM drive\n\nThis is an astounding digital Bible experience that is well worth the money, especially given the improvements that have been made in the software.  If you simply browse someone else's program you'll certainly want to have a copy as it brings out the wow factor.  The one thing to keep in mind is that it does use the NIV version of the Bible by Biblica (copyright 1984), Zondervan, as I realize this is not the version of choice by all people.  If you want to create and tailor your own Bible reading plan in a new, innovative way, this is one program you will probably enjoy tremendously.",
                "I used this today, going in from the roof.\n\nPros:\n* Works great to clean out lint - almost \"fun\" to use and see the lint come out\n* Comes with a short & helpful DVD (English & French)\n* I almost gave it 5 stars but because of the cons I think 4 stars is more appropriate\n\nCons:\n* *** BE CAREFUL *** Have to be careful not to purposely or *accidentally* put the drill into reverse or the brush head will detach\/unscrew\n* *** BE CAREFUL *** Set your drill clutch to no more than half of the maximum setting or the rods may break from too much torque\n* I wonder about the possibility of a rod breaking or brush unscrewing... I wonder how tough this thing is... it seems decent, but I would be more confident if it seemed very well built instead of just \"decent\".\n\nOther:\n* See the photos I uploaded. I was surprised how much lint came out.\n* My 3-year-old enjoyed watching the DVD over and over!\n* I went in from the exhaust on the roof and had the dryer blowing cool air out",
                "Bottom-Line: I have come to the conclusion the \"Men's Health\" is not written for me.\n\nThe world of men's magazines is festooned with glossy covers adorned with half dressed woman and mostly vapid content geared toward the more Neanderthal and or juvenile among us.  In a world filled with Maxim and Stuff magazines, \"Men's Health\" magazine stands out as a periodical with some substance, style and intellect, but after reading the latest issue I am certainly not sold.  And what is with all of the lists?\n\nI had been meaning to pick up an issue of \"Men's Health Magazine\" for quite some time when I picked up a copy--the October 2007 issue--while shopping for a computer manual at Borders.  The cover--as they always tend to do--featured a rather buff Jason Statham and article titles in big bold letters designed to catch the attention of that man looking for advise on Six-Pack ABS, or how to Dress for More Sex, or how to Eat Better and Think Smarter, or (my favorite) read what 1,293 Sexy Women Confess What They Want in Bed.\n\n\"Men's Health Magazine,\" whose tag line is Tons of Useful Stuff, was founded in 1987 and is published 10 times a year by the Rodale Inc.  The magazine began publishing in the United Kingdom in 1995.  Today \"Men's Health Magazine\" is published in 36 editions worldwide, distributed to 48 countries, and enjoyed a (2005) U.S. circulation of some 1.8 million.\n\nThe problem with \"Men's Health\" is that there is very little useful information to be found with the fold of the magazine despite it daunting size.  Most of the articles are snippets of information stuck between far too many glassy advertisements featuring young male models in clothing I would never wear and probably couldn't afford.  Same for the automobiles.  To be sure there was one rather lengthy article in the issue I read, but it was about dogs of all things!  The article I wanted to have some substance--a snippet on Michelle Ryan, the new Bionic Woman--was barely a page in length; how disappointing.\n\nAnd yes there was a snippet or two about healthy food, but nothing I didn't already know.  And the lists, there are endless lists of thing we can do to improve this or that, mostly dealing with self-image and sex; there are very few actually devoted to well, men's health.  Has our attention span grown so short that we must now condense or leisure reading into bullet points; endless lists that tell us how to live our lives?\n\nI have come to the conclusion the \"Men's Health\" is not written for me, a man in the middle of his life, settled, with a family, a regular job, with far too little time work workout, and far too little money to afford the rich life-style pimped by the magazine.  There is little practical information inside the glossy innards of \"Men's Health\" at least from my perspective.  Perhaps if I were young, rich, hip, the magazine would appeal to me, but I am none of those things, so...By the way what is the deal with all the lists?  Oh I already asked that question, I am still waiting for an answer.",

                "In today's game market it's easy to miss racing games that aren't part of the license-heavy Forza or Gran Turismo franchises. Dirt 3 for PC is in an even worse boat than most since it's been a giveaway for a couple years now with every DX11 compliant ATI video card. As a result a lot of people who get it send it straight to eBay and most people who do play it have not bought it new.\n\nThis is a shame because Dirt 3 is a fun little game. There's a great assortment of multinational tracks, and a wide array of classic and modern rally cars to choose from. As a rally game, Dirt 3 ditches the comfortable confines of tracks and sends you headlong across snow and gravel in a world where keeping control of your car is a greater skill than making it around the turns. Dirt 3 wears a veneer of noisy, fun arcade-style game play, but under the hood it calls for quick reactions, a good understanding of road surfaces, and nerves of steel. Sadly, it also calls for a gamepad or wheel- you will almost certainly find the keyboard too all-or-nothing for serious racing.\n\nPROS:\n-Visually stunning engine that makes full use of DirectX 11 effects\n-Soundtrack is an appealing mix of classic prog rock and modern music that does a good job of being vaguely European and not too intrusive\n-Successfully models an arcade-like complexity of play with a surprisingly deep simulation of track conditions and vehicle handling\n-In-car camera gives a stomach-churning stream of nonstop thrills as you launch over crests and 2-wheel hairpins\n-Probably the most realistic depiction of drifting\/powersliding to appear in a video game (it's frightening, nauseating, and usually a bad idea)\n-3D support!\n\nCONS:\n-Lower difficulties aren't much fun, highest difficulty is brutally hard\n-Small fanbase of hardcore racing nuts may make multiplayer a bit hard for newcomers (Dirt 3 players seem pretty nice though)\n-Essentially requires some sort of analog input\n-May confuse players who aren't familiar with the rules and conditions of rally-style racing\n\nOther thoughts:\n-You need to plug your youtube credentials into the game to let it export your highlights to YouTube. I don't think CodeMasters wants to rip you off, but if it makes you uncomfortable, create a new Google identity for use with Dirt 3. Easy!\n-LEARN THE TRACKS. Learn the tracks, learn the tracks, learn the tracks.\n-If you want to win, employ a Fin!",

There is no chemical burn or bad taste and is excellent for veneers and sensitive gums.\n\nAs a frequent traveler to countries where the water may not be safe to drink without boiling, beverages such as coffee and tea (instead of just plain water) are the norm in my diet and I had unattractive stains on my teeth no matter how hard or how often I brushed with regular toothpaste.  I hate the chemical taste  and burn of chemical whitening toothpastes so my dentist recommended Supersmile toothpaste as a way to help with the stains between visits.\n\nBy using Supersmile's toothpaste with an electric toothbrush at night before bed, I was able to remove most of the stains on my teeth and get them as naturally white as possible.  I love how the Supersmile accelerant is in a separate tube so I can choose when I need to use it in combination with the toothpaste (to get the inbetween teeth stains) to get my teeth beyond natural white (but not optical white).\n\nTo get the most out of this toothpaste, it needs to be used without water on an electric toothbrush for the full recommended 2-mins.

Most toothpastes make my mouth feel like it's on fire, but this toothpaste does not.\n\nMy teeth look and feel great. This toothpaste gives my teeth that squeaky clean feeling and my dentist said my enamel doesn't look like it's taking a beating either which is a plus.\n\nI couldn't recommend this toothpaste more. Skip the popular name brands and try this out. Yes, its more expensive, but a tube lasts me quite a long time and IT WORKS! The only downside is it can leave your toothbrush feeling hard after drying. This isn't too big of a deal for me personally, its just an annoying aspect. You also have to rinse with this toothpaste a bit. If you try it youll see why and what I mean. It leaves a milky white look behind even once you spit it out.\n\nI went a period without repurchasing when I needed to because my husband wanted to try charcoal. It did nothing except cause gum pain. Over the course of this time my teeth started to dull but after reordering this and using it just once, my teeth were already whiter again. Its been a few weeks and my teeth are blinding white again.\n\nThis is my HG toothpaste and I recommend it to all my friends and family as well. It's pretty amazing stuff.",

                "I have had Dreamweaver MX2004 since it came out back then. Spent years with it. Feel like I know it real well, but I am still familiar with tables as opposed to CSS. So I thought this would be a great introduction, and it is. The problem is that while I am looking at the video, and that simplifies things a lot, I am not getting the intuitive explanation as to why things work the way they do. I understand just knowing how to work them is sufficient. I'm tempted to delve into the rich full attributes of Dreamweaver CS5 as explained by this video, albeit difficult to understand the more advanced features, but I won't because this is about the video.\n\nThe opening salvo is chock full of... for example, this is the URL; this is where you type in the address bar etc. Only when you start to get into areas such as CSS do you get an introduction that for me is beneficial, and that is only because I am somewhat of a newbie to it. So there you have it, do you get an advanced lesson that flies through things and most find it hard to understand, or do you get this one and appreciate the fact that she walks you through everything step by step, even at the risk of boring the more in the know people, but finally arriving at the section you need to learn, and then appreciate that she is not moving at lightning speed.\n\nI'm holding off buying Dreamweaver CS5, although I got the upgrade to Photoshop CS5 and love it, because my MX2004 is not an eligible upgrade version. If I could qualify for the upgrade I would grab it, but the learning curve of CSS, and the steep price for the full version when I have MX2004 already is giving me some hesitation. If I was to upgrade, or should I say take the leap to the full version, this tutorial is the one I would use, and I also recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Adobe-Dreamweaver-CS5-on-Demand\/dp\/0789744449\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 on Demand<\/a>&nbsp;which makes a very good reference guide.\nAt some point I will get the new version of CS5 Dreamweaver, and at that point I will do the entire video series, and have a much more in depth analysis of it. But from what I can see after viewing a bunch of the video tutorials, it is the easiest way to indoctrinate you to the newest version. So I recommend it."

                "If your looking for a starter Uke and you want to learn, this is a good cheap way to start. Once the uke got tuned which takes about 2-3 days with the string stretch, it plays well and sounds good.\nIt's fit and finish isn't the best, and the sound is marginal, but overall it's a real decent value. Later when I have achieved more experience and talent, I can upgrade. I have paid so little for this setup, that it is easy for me to pass it along to someone else that wants to learn the Uke and there is no real financial loss.\nHint-Get the Snark SN-6 Ukulele Tuner. It is small and accurate, and makes Tuning a breeze.. which you will be doing a lot of the first few days. If it don't sound right to me, I just check it with the Snark. KEEP THIS FOR THE NEXT UPGRADE\n\nYou can put better sounding strings on this unit and it sounds better. But for learning the Uke.. it really can't be beat. I'd give it 5 stars if it were a better quality Uke... Plus it's a unit that can go on the road in a pack on a motorcycle, to the college dorm, and there is no worries your risking damage to an expensive unit. It's a perfect learning instrument. Then you can do with it what you want once your ready to upgrade... give it to a niece or nephew, grand child... send it off to college, you name it.. it will always be worth what you paid for it....\nI have no negitives.. it is what it is... designed to be a starter Ukulele, and it preforms that task with class... I am not afraid to show or let pro's play it and look at it.. they are also impressed with its quality at the cost. I used lemon oil on it and hand rubbed it out to a dull luster, and put better strings on it.. so with that.. it is impressive for the cost.\nThere are better Uke's on the market... those are for pro's. This is a starter unit.",
                "Can't believe this little gem. I ordered one for my wife sort of as a joke but after a week she was strumming songs on the guitar without the Chordbuddy. Last Sunday night, five weeks later, we had a picking at our church and she played along with us for two hours.\nNow a couple of things, l have played guitar professionally for years and I was able to show her some shortcuts and \"tricks\". She has learned to move between most chords quickly and without difficulty. I have her using a capo for songs in the key of C as she has some trouble holding F chord but she will master that.\nAlso, the instruction materials that come with the system are great. She faithfully practiced for at least an hour every night sore fingers and all but after five weeks I can't believe what she has accomplished.\nI don't believe that just anyone could do what she's done in five weeks because she was driven to play. I have a small recording studio and she plays piano for our recording sessions which helps her as she understands cord progression and structure.\nBut... If you have wanted to learn to strum a guitar using proper chords to play most any songs, don't hesitate to get the Chordbuddy. It is beyond doubt the best way to learn to play a guitar I've ever seen!",

                "Outside the supernova explosions of the early Jackson 5, Michael Jackson's peak years were '80-'82 of Off The Wall and Thriller. In fact, Thriller and its breakthrough, extended-length video dominated mainstream popular music during its amazing chart run. Those years, also, however, hosted rebellions against that same mainstream, with punk and new wave bands continually storming the staid pavilions. A lot of people were fed up with corporate crap, top-down thinking and the pop band as commodity\/tool. Michael Jackson was anything but staid, but he was of them. I mean, Quincy Jones! Industry creation though he was, Jackson synthesized the tension and energy around him to reach his creative zenith, plunging his music into the currency of sexual politics well-beyond the dance floor blatherings that typically decorate even genius killer grooves. He produced the toughest, most sophisticated work of his career in \"Billie Jean.\" That song touched off a widespread national conversation about the dangers and responsibilites of sex. But as big as Thriller was, Michael Jackson never again displayed the confident, at-ease sexuality of Off the Wall and his hits were scarcely more beloved than the best of hitmakers Hall and Oates from that point on. The opening Jackson 5 bombs detonate here as if preparing you, and the big early 80's hits still deliver a huge amount of excitement. This holds well up into \"Bad,\" opening the second CD, then slowly unwinds until midway into the second disc it completely disappears under a showcase of embarassing schlock. And that includes the DOA dance floor misfire \"Dangerous,\" which does nothing to illuminate beat cues cribbed from Prince. The Essential Michael Jackson shows a tantalizing artist on a blazing short run, shaping the best dance grooves in the land into actual cohesive songs. I certainly love him yet its pretty obvious listening to this Essentials package that Jackson's place in the pantheon is cushioned with padding.",

Not only did 3D whiten my teeth beyond Supersmile, I trust Crest for dental hygiene.  The Supersmile is cosmetic, the Crest is great toothpaste.

                "National Geographic is one of the items that is part of the fabric of our lives.  Every one of us, from somewhere, remembers reading them as a child.  Pictures of faraway places, animals and people different from us stoked our imaginations while creating a sense of wonder that such things existed.  Originally sold only by subscription many homes treasured the magazines carefully preserving them in bookcases.  This set provides all the issues from 1888 to 2008, 120 years, in one small box.  Each issue is presented page by page, starting at the front cover and proceeding to the back cover.  All the maps are here too.  The set shows the world as it was and the process of changing into the world of today.  This is a living history lesson showing how America changes and adjusts into the modern world.\nI am running this on a 64-bit VISTA system with no problems.  Print quality is excellent in even the 1888 issues.  A page magnifier is available but I have not found it necessary.  Photo quality varies over time.  The early issues have poor quality photographs because the printing process was not that great.  You can view all of the old photos but many are not that clear an image.  The interface is not intuitive but it is not impossible to use either.  I have several of these collections and cannot comment of how a first time user will find this.  There are better interfaces but this is not an impossible one and it is fully supported.\nIs it worth it?  That depends on you.  Can you lose yourself in looking at pictures of Europe in 1925?  Would you want to read about the Pacific Northwest in the 1930?  Can you spend a couple of hours looking at advertisement of products that no longer exist?

After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.\nI noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

There are more than twelve hours of video training included in this package, most of it split up in the small, absorbable sections.  This courseware is \"Certified Associate,\" approved courseware.  Dreamweaver is the premier product for website creation.  It offers several new advantages\/features for the user.  It has improved dynamic applications, new CSS features that offer more control over your design, you can turn individual CSS properties on and off (you can see how they affect your designs), and you can fuse box model elements to troubleshoot directly within Dreamweaver.  If you are confident this DVD\/book bundle is for you, you can simply bypass this review or read some shorter versions (this is a very long review).  If not, keep on reading.\n\nWith this software you'll learn a lot of basics, however, if you are already a web designer or have a lot of experience, you may find a lot of the material to be redundant.  On the other hand, if you are anxious to learn web design, this is the perfect place to start.  Taking a course can cost you a lot of $, but this course is quite affordable ... if you decide it is not for you, then you can hand it along to someone else.

At the end of each section is a \"test\" to enable you to know just how you are progressing on each section.\n\nIf you are in a bookstore you can easily pick up a copy and glance at the book, but you cannot see what is on the DVD.  I'll try to describe what is on the DVD to the buyer can get a good understanding of what is on there and can decide if Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 is what they need.

                "I'm leaving my original review below: However, I adjusted the rating to reflect the fact that I had to return this item because the neck snapped off from the body while in the padded case I had purchased for it. Due to this issue, I really think you would be in better shape buying the Hola! uke here on Amazon for a few more bucks and a separate tuner and instruction book. Youtube tutorials are invaluable, and plentiful. I hate to decrease my star rating, but it's obviously a low quality instrument and the Hola! uke is light years better sounding and looking.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Hola-HM-121MG-Deluxe-Soprano-Ukulele-Mahogany-Binding-and-Aquila-Strings\/dp\/B00ATABRJE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hola! HM-121MG+ Deluxe Soprano Ukulele, Mahogany + Binding and Aquila Strings<\/a>Don't let this review stop you from picking up ukulele! This kit got me going, so it was worth the money, even if Amazon hadn't refunded me!\n\nI'm a woodwind girl, but wanted something to take camping for around the campfire. Ordered this because it was a kit and on price point alone.  For the price paid, this has given me a lifelong hobby and a way to connect with my kids. Huge value.\n\nThe bag is pretty useless. It's thin and crinkly with no protective qualities, really. I suppose it would protect from sunlight and dust.  The cd and DVD are good, but I have gotten much more use out of youtube tutorials!  However, having the chords there in the book are nice, and does provide some basic musical notation info.\n\nThe instrument is obviously a \"starter\" uke. It's light and the finish isn't beautiful, but it doesn't look like a toy, either. The matte finish does attract fingerprints and is very plain. I bought some rub on transfers to personalize and decorate, which made me happier.  The strings do have to be tuned frequently, but I expected that from the reviews. After three weeks of daily playing they tune easier and stay tuned longer but still need tuning before each session. I bought  the Hola! Electronic tuner and just leave it clipped on. Works beautifully.  I think the sound is pretty and it seems reasonably well made for the price. I'm sure I will trade up in a year or two, but this is a great starter.\n\nI would recommend this for anyone wanting to give ukulele a whirl. It's a fast learning curve, and super fun!",

                "This magazine has a lower cover price than some of its competitors, and makes up for it with a massive amount of ads. A few ads contain coupons, for those that like to cut those little things out (unfortunately they are hardly ever for anything I want !). The paper is also a lot thinner than the higher priced home\/garden publications, and the photographs do not reproduce that well on it.\nOn the bright side, there are many nice d&eacute;cor ideas, and simply terrific recipes.\nTaking the October 2003 edition as an example, Fall colors and produce are the theme. It has some ideas on how to display gourds, and an article on a community pumpkin patch, from the June planting by 140 neighbors and friends in a 6000 square ft. area, to harvest time.\nThere are numerous articles on remodeling, \"Foolproof Potted Plants\", on the joys of having hardy succulents in your home, and a lovely piece with lots of photographs on actor Peter Strauss' gorgeous Ojai, California garden.\nThe best article of all, is \"The Magic of Soup\", and some of these recipes are so good they might end up in your family for generations. They are simple to prepare, with easy to find ingredients, and will make a healthy, hearty meal for those frosty days ahead. Also included with the recipes is the preparation and cooking time, and nutritional statistics.\nAs someone who writes a lot of notes and cards, I appreciate the final page which is about letter writing, and how this vanishing form of communicating is good for the soul.\nAll things considered, this magazine gives good value, and is meant for those of us who do not live in a mansion or have hours to devote to a single recipe.",

                "Michael Jackson gave us so much wonderful music during his lifetime; and this two CD set showcases his fine talent. Michael is consistently at the top of his game on these tracks; there's not a dud in the bunch. The quality of the sound on these two CDs is excellent and I like the artwork as well.\n\n\"I Want You Back\" starts the first CD off with Michael doing a great job with the rest of The Jackson 5; they sing and play this to perfection--and beyond! \"ABC\" is very catchy. \"Got To Be There\" is a very romantic song that is truly a classic; Michael's genius is clearly abundant even at a very early age. He sings \"Got To Be There\" with all his heart and soul; and he never lets go of a single superfluous note, either! \"Rockin' Robin\" is infectiously catchy and upbeat, too--and how's about that guitar solo?\n\n\"Ben\" is a masterpiece even if Michael is singing a song about a pet rat (!!!); Michael's excellent diction makes \"Ben\" even more beautiful. \"Enjoy Yourself\" again has Michael with the rest performing just wonderfully; and it's got that `70s beat I always like so much. \"Blame It on the Boogie\" is still perfect for dancing nearly wherever you are; and there's yet another gem in \"Shake Your Body (Down To the Ground).\" Listen also for Michael to deliver \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\" without ever skipping a beat; and he does outstanding work as he sings \"Rock with You;\" \"Off The Wall\" and a great duet with Paul McCartney entitled \"The Girl Is Mine.\" \"Billie Jean\" was a huge hit for Michael when it was released; and it remains one of his best tunes ever. It's got some beat! \"Beat It\" is yet another jewel on the first CD. \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" is another catchy, infectious tune that sticks in your mind forever once you hear it; and I especially like \"Thriller;\" \"Thriller\" is timeless and just one listen proves it!\n\n\"Bad\" is another awesome tune that features Michael squarely front and center; that music fits in perfectly with his vocals but wisely they never try to steal the show away from MJ--he stands right there, front and center where he belongs! \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" gets a most sensitive treatment from Michael and Siedah Garrett; and \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" is pop music at its very best. \"Man in the Mirror\" is a meaningful tune with a sensitive flavor to it; and Michael does a superb job on \"Another Part of Me.\" I love it! \"Black or White\" is very well done; Michael sings this with lots of energy and it helps the number a lot. \"Heal The World\" is very sweet and easy on the ear--this music lacks nothing, it's all THAT good.\n\n\"Remember The Time\" has an eerie sound to it that nevertheless sounds really good; it's truly more classic pop as only Michael could do it. \"Will You Be There\" uses a choir in the background for a nice effect; and \"Dangerous\" has some beat! \"You Are Not Alone\" is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard; no wonder why so many people love Michael Jackson's songs! The second CD ends well with MJ performing \"You Rock My World.\" Awesome!\n\nMichael Jackson fans should consider this a \"must-have\" for their collections; and it has so many songs that it makes the perfect introduction to MJ and his music for newcomers just discovering his magic. I highly recommend this two CD set.",
                "I purchased this set, based on the reviews, as a gift for a young neice.  Rather than just giftwrapping the box, I took the uke out, tuned it, retuned it, stretched the strings, retuned it.  After 2 days, it would hold tune for about 3 minutes of playing (junk strings are probably to blame).  I did all this because my neice would be a beginner and therefore be easily frustrated by an instrument that would not hold tune.  Next I went to a \"learn to play\" site on the net and found C Am F G7 chord diagrams and started to attempt to play.  The strings were so high off the fretboard that any note fingered above the 3rd fret would pull the string out of tune.  The easy chords were difficult because the high strings got in the way of my fingers so that I could not finger a chord cleanly.\n\nWith the intonation and tuning problems, I was not willing to give this instrument to my neice, so next I went to a local music store to see if a set of strings and some shaving of the saddle (the white peice on the bridge that the strings rest on) would make it playable.  In order to gain a frame of reference, I picked up a $78 uke and strummed my newly learned chords.  It sounded and played great!  I told the music store guy that I wanted this uke to play like the $78 one.  He said the the cost would equal the original cost and still might not produce a good instrument.  Then he showed me a $40 instrument, an entry level uke from  Kala or Lanakai.  It played like the more expensive one, but didn't have the pretty binding, etc.  I loved it and bought it.  When I got home I called for an RMA and will send the much inferior Firebrand uke with all the books and cd's back to the seller.  The sellers were nice and seemed concerned about selling an unplayable instrument.  It's too close to Christmas to waste time on this one.  Hope this helps you out.",

                "The bottom line:  I like this deal much better than trying to buy an Office 365 license outright from Microsoft because it's cheaper, you get more, and you have a lot more options.\n\nThe full review:\nMore to the point though, Office has become a different animal than it was.  In the long run, Office 365 is a better deal than buying a downloadable, installable product--because you *get* a downloadable, installable product with this deal.\n\nSo what exactly are you getting here?\n\nThis package is the ability to use the latest version of Office in the browser--meaning, if you're on a machine that doesn't have Office installed, you can log into your Microsoft account (required) and use browser-based versions of all the Office apps.  This also means that the online storage place called \"OneDrive\" (formerly known as \"SkyDrive\") can be used to store up to one TeraByte (1,000GB) of stuff, anything you like, private or public or just shared out as you wish.\n\nIt's ALSO the ability to download and install Office 2013 OR Office 2016, on up to 5 machines, for up to 4 people!  That's the cool part.  In the past, you might have to buy more than one copy of Office, or be the sole user, or only put it on a desktop and a laptop.  Now I can put this on my desktop, laptop, and Surface Pro, then install it on my wife's PC and my daughter can also have a copy installed to use.  I've been running Office 2016 for the most part and have been pretty happy with the way it works.  2016 is not hugely different from 2013 or 2010, just in little ways.\n\nThis package lets you use Office for a year.  You can buy two or three and stack them to prolong your subscription (if you're afraid the price of Office will go up) or you can extend your subscription to more people (in case you have a bunch of kids and want to add mom and dad and grandma into the number of users).  I added a year using this code.  It was only easy to do because I looked online first for HOW to do it.\n\nWhich brings us to the only real drawback to Office 365:  anything to do with the browser.  The browser-based apps try to be as much like the desktop as possible, but they're still not quite the same.  OneNote is probably the closest match I've seen, while Outlook is the ugliest and least useful.  The fact that the browser-based versions run in Azure (\"the Cloud\", a.k.a., \"on the Internet\") means that they typically run a bit slower, depending on your Internet connection.  OneDrive is more annoying to manage using the browser, so I find myself using a computer to do most of the work like uploading files\/folders, creating new folders, etc.  I use the browser-based OneDrive interface to download individual stuff or share stuff out to people.  The entire browser interface is trying to do the \"Kanban\" look that you also see in Windows 8's \"Metro-now-called-Modern\" apps and parts of Windows 10's look and feel.\n\nMy rule of thumb is that the browser-based Office is for small tasks on the go, but for anything substantial I go with the PC.\n\nYou also have to use the Office website to mange things like who you share Office with, or how you download.  They make it annoyingly over-complicated to download the 64-bit version of Office if you don't want to use the 32-bit.  You have to choose \"Install-->Language and Install Options-->Additional Install Options--> then pick the specific 64-bit version you want.  There's no good reason to bury the better-performing version that far down except that they hope it prevents tech support complications.\n\nThe Home Subscription is: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and a 1TB bump-up to OneDrive, up to 4 people across 5 machines.\nThe Personal Subscription is the same, but only for one individual user, on up to 5 machines.\nThe Business version has a lot of other options *and* things to consider when choosing.\n\nOverall, I find this a much better deal than shelling out a few hundred dollars up front and knowing the next version will require me to buy it again, and I don't get the benefit of the added OneDrive storage space.  With this price, it's cheaper and I will always have the option of downloading the latest version of Office or sticking with the one I have.  The browser-based versions I consider an afterthought, or \"bonus feature\" - I wouldn't rely solely on those for everyday work.  And I would like to see managing the subscriptions and installs get a bit easier.",

                "...But not so because of it's lack of completion. As in the past Greatest Hits compilations by Michael and The Jacksons, there has always been filler...but no thriller, hits with pits! So this compilation IS the best so far!! Pictures included are his best photos showing off a talented singer\/songwriter and not the everchanging cosmetic mess. The quality of the mastering is far superior than previous compilations including that of the earlier hits from Motown...like I Want You Back, ABC and Got To Be There. The track information is informative and I don't recall another compilation that has such details.\n\n  But the reason for the 1 less star is that it did not complete the Essential and added 2 songs that were not Essential for this type of CD. Granted he has had more #1 hits and more top 40 hits than most!! Over 4 decades here, from 1970 - 2000!\n\nBut where is the # 1 Essential I'll Be There or Dancing Machine?\n\nThey could have left out Dangerous which never charted and Leave Me Alone which is an essential, but not a hit as well.

Open the document you wish to create, answer the questions you are presented with and your document is done.\n\nThe software also includes multiple forms. Including various policy documents for when your business grows a little larger and you need to start implement various employee policies.  There are employee agreements, non-compete clauses, NDA, and various tax forms.\n\nThere are 5 ebooks included to help you business plans, loans, legal guide, employment law, and tax information.\n\nThis is a must have software for anyone just starting out in business.

                "Once you get familiar with with how this works, then it's easier to strategize how and when to use it.  It's very messy to work with and takes a long while to set up.  I've used GG (and other brands of the same type of glue - which, incidentally, seem to be identical to the point that I don't really have a preference) for countless things over the years:  I repaired the broken frame of a Nordictrack skier that developed a crack (I glued the crack and clampled it, as well as glueing and screwing a piece of wood to the side, along the crack and a few inches beyond on either side), put a kickboard on the screen door of our front door which is starting to deteriorate at the lower corner, built a small playhouse ladder, and about a million other things I can't recall.\n\nIt works well and bonds seem to be very strong.  I generally use glue as a supplement, not as the only source of bonding (if possible).  I've repaired some non-wood items as well.  Some have worked fine, some not.  As another review mentions, you can peel the dried glue off of the nozzle when you're opening it for another use - so it's probably not the best choice for plastics.  I've done some ceramics and it's been fine - the foaming as it dries can of course make the end results look less-than-perfect.\n\nOverall GG is very useful, and there are plenty of things for which it works very well and where, say, super glue doesn't do the trick.  I don't know if it's better than wood glue for wood projects.  From what I hear it's not, but I don't always have wood glue around, so I'll use this.\n\nThe most important advice I can give is: don't buy too big of a bottle unless you really use it a lot.  When you're done using it, squeeze as much air out of the bottle as you can.  I've never been able to actually finish a bottle of this kind of glue, because as I get to the last third or so, it usally hardens or there's so much dried glue at the top of the bottle that I have to cut apart the bottle to get to the remaining glue.  Squeezing out as much air as possible before closing the cap will mitigate this to a large degree, but at some point you just can't get enough air out and so you start to see the crusty, hardened end of the life of your precious bottle of glue somewhere on the horizon.  It's the circle of life.  For glue, anyway.",

                "Even though I use Dreamweaver a great deal and own several books on the subject, I found this set very helpful. Candyce Mairs takes you through everything, from opening the program and setting up your desktop to creating a site. The focus is on the software, not on CSS or HTML or web design, so you'll end up with a through understanding of just how the software is designed to work.\n\nThe videos are brief, with clear screenshots and step by step narration which is subtitled. When occasionally the narrator makes a small error (\"Fireworks\" for \"Firefox,\" say), the subtitles correct it. The pace is slow but focused and always on task -- no rambling or making and fixing errors on screen.\n\nSince each video looks at just one issue, it's very easy to find your way back if you feel confused. I like the \"Watch and work\" option, too, which lets you keep the video running in the corner of your screen so that you can work along with the video.\n\nNew features of CS5 are pointed out in detail, not only in the video training but in the accompanying booklet, which also has tables of keyboard shortcuts, a glossary, and lots of example code.\n\nIf you're upgrading and want to master the new features immediately or if you usually hand code and want to get to know all the timesaving features of Dreamweaver, this is exactly what you need. If you're a moderately skilled web designer and would like to increase your skills, improving your ability to use Spry, for example, this is an excellent choice. It's probably not enough for the absolute beginner -- you'll still need to learn HTML and CSS and web design theory, but this is the best I've seen for using Dreamweaver in particular.",

It uses a simple question and answer format using a combination of questions, drop-downs and menu options.  You're guided through the process step by step. This can feel tedious if you're used to using a spreadsheet, but actually makes sense for the forms provided.  It took about 10 minutes to create an invoice, but during that process the software stored my customer's information and my information - so next time it will go even faster.\n\nThe program could not be any easier to use!  Installation was easy, and as a bonus for registering you're sent a download link for \"101 Law Forms for Personal Use\" - a 392 page version of the book.\n\nThe program and the PDF file both depend on the nolo website for support, online forms, updates. etc. Some of these services are free to registered users, others are free to all."

                "The other reviewers wrote some great info about this Microphone.  Some drawbacks are the relatively bulkyness of this unit as compared to others.\nThe sound quality is sufficiently clear when recording, but is not sensitive enough to satisfy the most demanding users such as musicians or professional reporters.  As the other reviewers have said, you need a relatively loud source as there is no sensitivity switch or zoom feature.  It does have the 90-120 degree switch, so you can toggle the range depending on what you are recording.\nThis microphone is very compatible with many different devices.  MD is the best though.\nHere's one MD player recorder that I know has the microphone jack and works great with this microphone:\n'Sony MZ-NF810CK Net MD MiniDisc Recorder with Car Kit'\nHowever, don't be fooled.  Not every MD player has the appropriate Mic Jack.  Double Check the technical documentation to make sure.  Units that definitely do not have it are:\n'Sony MZ-NE410 High Speed Net MD Walkman Recorder'\nNotice the deceptive \"Recorder\" moniker in the product name.  Don't be fooled!

I don't mind that it is not wireless, since I wouldn't move around much anyways.  Also, the fact that it doesn't have buttons didn't bother me, mainly because I don't mind using a controller to navigate.  I do think it could have been packaged better, but I don't fault the microphone for it.  Overall, a very simplistic, yet functional, design that works well."

These oak desks were very good quality, but they unfortunately had an ugly black top on them.  I am unsure of what the black surface is, but it seems to be some sort of plastic\/synthetic.  After stripping the desks and removing the edge trim from the tops, I used Gorilla glue to attach furniture grade oak plywood to the black surface.  After making a new edge banding and using traditional finishing techniques, the desks look like a million bucks.  I experimented with other adhesives, but found Gorilla glue to be the absolute best for strength, working time, and cost.  There is a bit of ooze-out when clamping pressure is applied, but I just wait for the glue to dry and scrape the hardened seepage with a chisel befor sanding.  I highly recommend this glue!!!",

                "It takes a little practice to get used to these, and I kind of feel like it's a case of \"controlled chaos\" working with them. There's a lot of things that can go wrong, so they are potentially very dangerous. I didn't realize the first time I used them when you get to the very top of the lift, the weight of the jacks themselves will tend to push the wall over. I was trying to stop the wall from moving, and both of the jacks in  unison were fighting against me. I was very lucky that one edge of the top plate caught against an adjacent wall long enough for me to pull the jack out of place. I would have lost the wall otherwise.\n\nAfter that first little adventure I started to tie rope to the wall, but this is also a case of controlled chaos. If your ropes are too long, they can stretch, and the bottom of the wall can kick in and go over too. I find it best to get the walls within about 3 inches of plumb, brace the wall and get rid of the jacks. Then, and only then, push the wall into plumb.\n\nThese are very handy, but I would advise anyone using them to start with small walls (10') or so before approaching anything much heavier.  I can also say it takes about 45 min. to set everything up vs. about 15 min. with a helper. Of course if you have no helper, these are gold.

                "Update June 2013:\nDeeply disappointed at the lack of a non-linear open-world environment. But its the restrictive QTE gameplay and final-kill cut-scenes that kill the game for me. I loath enforced QTE. When a mission goes awry and you're trying to escape a hail of bullets, if you happen to brush past an assailant you can't escape QTE mode. Meanwhile you're being shot at from all sides. It just lacks the sense of freedom that Blood Money had, and it takes you out of the whole gaming experience placing you instead into a second-rate interactive movie.\n\nAs a loyal fan of the Hitman franchise, I waited years for this. I would have loved if they had added driving into the game in order to rival Saints Row or the GTA series etc. What they did add took away from the game. For instance they should have kept the semi-open-worlds of Blood Money and build-on those beautiful sets, maps and locations.\n\nI would have loved if Hitman had been as open as Skyrim. Overall Dishonored's gameplay is a far superior hitman style gaming experience. But I wish they had had Bioshock Infinite's breathtaking visuals in that particular game.\n\n==================================================================\n\nWow after all these years waiting-- this is it.....?!!!\n\nI am still a huge fan of Blood Money. The fact that you can now play it again online for free is a huge plus! To play, all you have to do is watch a 30-second ad on mute and you get sufficient time to play a level. Who can complain about that? But this, what took them so long to produce a bad cousin of Metal Gear Solid?!\n\nIntuition....? STOP! STOP! STOP Please let me use my own intuition! And what is it with the game constantly talking to you like you're an idiot? All this serves to do is kill any the sense of atmosphere, tension and suspense!\n\nYou want to know how bad this game is....? They use cut scenes for the final kill, thus killing any sense of pay off! And you can't even skip through the intro level! Hello? This was a cult game... So lots of people know how to play it and don't need this hand holding to be mandatory!\n\nThe graphics too are little improvement over Blood Money, and are definitely a let down compared to the current generation of games. There is less of a non-linear feel about this version also. Now you're not quite tied to a string as you walk through levels, but its sub par compared with the freedom of its predecessor IMHO.\n\nSuch a shame, such a shame.

                "1) Elmers \"Ultimate High Performance\" is a Polyurethane (PU) glue and it's as good as Gorilla (another PU Glue) (As far as I can tell) but cheaper. also used the PL brand glue and can't tell any notable difference between the three. Have not used Sumo and from what I understand it sets up faster and as a result apparently has a much more limited shelf life (this is generally not a good thing - see item #2)\n\n2) This has a limited shelf life and you probably don't need as much as you think. PU glue foams up and you use a LOT less than other types of glue. 4 oz should be more than enough for most people, 8 oz is a BIG bottle - I can't even imagine buying the 16 oz bottle. PU Glues suck moisture out of the air so unless you plan on using it up within a year or two, a LOT is going to go to waste. Don't ask me how I know this.\n\n3) PU Glue is FANTASTIC for lots of things but woodworking glues are still better for woodworking. They are stronger and you can't clean PU glues up with water the way you can even with the waterproof Titebond products. Also if you use biscuits you will have to moisten them separately to get them to swell.\n\n4) KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN AND ANIMALS! PU glue is waterproof and will swell and harden inside the digestive tract creating a blockage. There is NO antidote and surgery is typically the only solution. There have been MANY cases - just search Google \"Dog Gorilla Glue\" Wear gloves (rubber or vinyl) and use lots of wax paper.\n\n5) Aliphatic wood glues (Like Titebond II) are still better for wood to wood bonding. Fine Woodworking did a test (Issue #192) and found Polyurethane glues to be about half as strong.\n\n[...]\n\nIf you've found this review helpful, please let me know!",

                "According to my order history, I bought this this kit towards the end of 2012 as a Black Friday Week Lightning Deal. I'm writing this nearly four years later.\n\nAs with any stringed instrument, the strings really needed to stretch out before they would stay in tune. So, for the first several days, it was play a few minutes, tune, play a few minutes, tune. Then it was tuning daily. After a few weeks of this, the uke held a tune great. A tuner is not included in the package, which is the bulk of the minus star because a real beginner wouldn't have a way to tune the thing. (You need either a tuner or a reference note, say, on a piano or keyboard.) You can download a decent tuner app, though, for a buck or so. Do it, because you're going to need it a lot for the first couple of weeks.\n\nThe \"Firebrand\" ukulele is a laminated instrument of unknown wood. It's kind of dead-sounding. But then, soprano ukes generally sound a bit flattish to me - it's part of their distinctive character. The finish, while smooth, is spotty, and the decal around the sound hole has bubbles. But the fretboard is just barely adequately finished, with frets that are nicely flush with the edge of the neck so the feel is smooth - and has stayed smooth despite temperature changes. The beveled fret edges are filed, but not especially polished; even so, there's nothing to snag or catch. Fret dots are inset (one quite deeply) into the fingerboard and also painted on the upper edge of the neck, a nice touch. The action on mine is okay, at least down near the headstock where the starter chords live. The tuners are a triumph of cost-engineering: stamped metal with solid gears, so they're a definite step up from simple peg tuners. They make fine adjustments quite smoothly, and hold well over time. The bridge is slotted, so when you re-string you don't have to mess with that weird knot, just knot the end.\n\nI visited a specialty ukulele shop yesterday thinking of upgrading, and played with budget beginner soprano ukes costing three times what I paid for this whole set, and to me they played about the same and most even sounded the same; a few were a bit louder. They were all, however, finished to a much higher standard. I left empty-handed, but will probably get a better uke sometime soon. They're fun!\n\nThe bag is lightly made, unpadded, and has a fixed-length strap for carrying. It offered no advantage over just grabbing the uke to carry it, while adding the considerable disadvantage of needing to unpack it to play. It promptly went into the giveaway pile.\n\nWe haven't watched the DVDs, because the book has been great. It starts with C7 and F, and then adds C and G7, then G and D7. So it's not the C Am F G combo very common on YouTube. The songs are American folk traditionals, so if you've been around a campfire where any singing was involved, you've probably heard them before. There are lots of good instructions available online, including videos, so, really, the book is just a kick-starter to get you going. It's a pretty good book, with a reference section at the back with more chord diagrams than you're likely to need.\n\nIn all, it's an acceptable inexpensive starter set, not worth the \"list price\" but an OK value at Amazon's discounted price and a bargain at the Gold Box\/Lightning Deal price.\n\nUPDATE: I changed the strings to the Aquila Nylgut AQ-4 set. Yeah, they're $10 strings on a $15 instrument, but the improvement in sound is just huge. I also polished the frets and fingerboard with a \"magic eraser\"-like product (an ultra-fine abrasive), shined up the body, and filed down the plastic saddle (which simply pops out of the bridge) to lower the action. It plays and sounds much better now, although the intonation remains sharp on several notes if you go note-for-note up the frets.\n\nUPDATE #2: OK, after going through the book I binge-watched the DVD. It consists of two segments of about 33 minutes each, each segment subdivided into easy-to-locate chapters that follow the pages of the book. It's really very good! The \"instructor\" (and remember, I bought this four years ago so this may have changed) was musician Julia Jordan. Production values were good, and the multi-angle views of playing were helpful, as were all the play-along segments. Minor quibbles: Jordan played a larger ukulele than the one in the pack, so you can't hold it in the exact same way. And it seemed like the songs were keyed to a higher register than her natural speaking\/singing voice (you can hear her singing her own songs on a special feature and she's very pleasant to listen to).\n\nUPDATE #3: I now own a couple better ukuleles, have been a member of a ukulele meetup, and play a little almost every day. I can tell the difference between any of my better ukes and this one by both feel and ear. Still, it's a totally useable instrument, and it got me started on an enjoyable little musical hobby. Just remember to download a tuner app and maybe a metronome app and you're good to go.",

First of all anyone with this program, BUY the extra environments and cars. It is money well spent and a first class job of an addon. I wanted everyone to know that this program is still the top of the heap in graphics. I bought Battlefield 3 and it is good, but not the standard of the ego 2 engine.

                "I'm not quite finished with the game's DiRT Tour mode, but I believe I've experienced the bulk of what the game has to offer.  And I'm happy to say that the game is indeed awesome.  Great cars, great tracks and racing modes, excellent gameplay and graphics.  The highlight has been racing in the snow on various tracks in Aspen.  There are also some really cool obstacle courses on pavement, which are new to the series.\n\nAt first, I felt that the game was plagued with the same difficulty spike DiRT 2 had, where you can win any race without trying on casual difficulty, then lose big time on medium.  Then I found the custom difficulty settings where you can choose from 5 levels of challenge, then pick and choose from all the other assists and handling options.  Basically, you can let the game play itself by just holding the throttle and steering, or take gradual steps to reach what you feel works best for you.  Love this feature!  Sadly, there is no option to increase the 360 controller's dead zone or adjust the sensitivity.  I'm doing ok as is, but some tweaking would be ideal.\n\nMuch like the previous two games, the handling is a bit flighty.  But that's speeding on loose ground for you.  Still, I feel things have tightened up somewhat since DiRT 2.  Still no cigar, but it's a step forward.  The game runs as smooth as silk on my 560ti wih all the settings maxed.  No issues whatsoever.  If you enjoy racing games, this is not one you should ignore.  It's the best DiRT so far.",

I was initially sceptical about the high price, having bought them after all my others, and for more money, but I now think they may well have been my best-value purchase of the lot. I certainly use them more than all the others for convenience including outside jobs with potentially suspect weather (I got the matching outdoor speaker covers and so they can play on their stands outdoors in light rain). I remember at an outdoor gig once, the wind blew my projector screen unto my K10 speaker and stand, so that the K10 fell about 7ft to the hard asphalt ground. It suffered a small dent on the front grill (was in the cover), but did not skip a beat and kept right on playing through the incident, and have continued on with no problems ever since\n\nAll in all, a really fine powered pro speaker.

                "I'm not sure why so many people are having problems downloading and installing Microsoft Office 365. As long as an account is setup before trying to downloading the product, it downloaded and installed easily for me. Yes, it took time. After all, this is a bloated Microsoft product. This version of Office is sort of a hybrid, or so it feels - partly in the cloud, but mostly on your computer. That it good for people on the go and need to access documents that may have been saved at different locations on different machines or devices. Documents can be saved to the Skydrive associated with your account. In order to use this program, unlike a standard office version, you must be logged into the account you created, or a previous account that can be linked to the subscription. The subscription includes free apps (must be downloaded from the app stores) for iPhone and I would imagine Android and Windows mobile as well, which allow viewing and editing documents as well as accessing the Skydrive from a mobile device (Don't tell the boss about this).\n\nThe new look of Office 365 is more in line with Windows 8, but it is flat, colorless and dull. Microsoft does not give you many options to change it either. There are three different themes to choose from - White, Light Gray and Dark Gray. Wow! Microsoft really? I would at least have expected a light blue like Office 2007 offered. At least if White or Light Gray is chosen there is a thin line of color at the bottom status bar, with dark gray chosen this is black. The color changes based on the program being used - blue for Word, green for Excel, etc. There is also a background pattern that can be chosen which is really just in the top right hand corner of the screen. These uninteresting patterns are grey, but vary in shade based on the \"theme\" chosen. Pretty unexciting.\n\nAs far as functionality goes, Office hasn't changed that much in the last few versions, there is a customizable ribbon at the top which changes based on the tab that is chosen. Microsoft has done away with any sort of shading or shadowing to make the ribbon stand out in any way, it is incredibly flat looking, which is kind of disconcerting, and at times confusing. Clicking on \"File\" (which for some reason always has a colored box around it) slides open another screen where there are other options. This is where more of a Windows 8 look comes into play (and a little bit more color). The options are pretty much the same as in other Windows versions, just presented differently. Save As offers an option to save to the computer as well as to the Skydrive. Microsoft installs a program that loads when the computer is started that keeps the Skydrive in sync with all the documents saved there. The icon in the computer's toolbar is a cloud with a green line moving from left to right. Because it is constantly synching, there is a noticeable, but not intolerable lag when typing, as compared to a non-cloud based system.\n\nOffice 365 comes with a license for up to 5 PC's or Macs which makes the $99.00 a year (at time the of review) price a good deal if utilizing all of them, since it offers the full Office suite, 20 GB storage on the Skydrive and 60 minutes of Skype per month all included in the subscription. It does not turn out to be such a good deal if it is only being used on one PC or Mac, in which case it might be better to get a non-subscription version which costs more upfront, but can be used until its obsolescence at no charge. The other versions offer the same features without the Skype credits and less storage space on the Skydrive. Windows 7 or 8 is required to run any new version of Microsoft Office product.\n\nMicrosoft Office is pretty much the world standard for software of this type. Other software has come and gone, so it is almost essential to own some version of Office these days. While Office 365 is not my favorite version that Microsoft has created, it's not that bad either. The lack of color makes their product boring and hard to navigate, and because there is no option to change this is frustrating. Microsoft needs to put some style into its office products.",

                "We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer.  I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.  A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.",

                "I've been creating websites with Dreamweaver for years now, and all that experience has taught me one thing - I'm a hack web designer.  Recently I have been trying to learn industry CSS standards and had heard that Dreamweaver has made great advances in CSS management in CS4 and CS5. I'm embarrassed to say what version I am using.\n\nWhen I got a chance to get a reviewer copy of this training set I jumped for two reasons, first I was mulling over spending the money to upgrade to DW CS5 and I second I have always that I was missing out on a lot of DW's capabilities.  It's now obvious that I should upgrade for the CSS management upgrades alone.\n\nAs for the value of the training - I couldn't be happier.  This is not an advanced tips and tricks resource, nor is it an exhaustive boot camp in web page authoring, but it is a fairly thorough training taking you from site planning and design to creation and publishing.  I watched the videos from beginning to end and they start pretty basic with an HTML refresher then move to the meatier DW specific training.  I can see myself returning to several sections later to brush up.\n\nPersonally, the CSS, Media, and Forms training videos were enough to justify the price tag.  The training lessons were short and easily digestible.  I liked that it broke training into 3-10 minutes so I had some time to do a little more in-depth googling on subjects like text wrapping on absolute positioned CSS objects (which it won't.) or checking my version of DW.\n\n  What this is\n  - An Adobe Certification Training Aid - so it starts from a very low level introduction and  goes through the entire DW web creation process\n  - A wonderfully designed interface\n  - A great overview of using DW\n\nWhat it isn't\n  - A substitute for spending the time working with DW (but it will jump start a novice)\n  - An expert tips and tricks reference\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this to anyone trying to learn DW or even web design in general. The CSS placement section has been the most enlightening coverage of the topic I have been able to find.  The author's delivery on the videos is great and the interface is the best, most intuitive I have seen. The only bad thing I can say is that the closed captioning is defaulted on, so at times it covered the bottom of the properties table at the bottom of the screen. So sometimes I had to close it to see things the author was pointing out.  But all in all, this is an absolutely wonderful product.",
