I am a beginner, so I should have first enrolled for a course explaining the fundamentials and showing how a standard screenplay looks like.\nHowever, I find the course very interesting and useful, especially for those with some experience. \nWhat is also precious personaly for me is that I got interested in screewriting after watching all movies with Jonathan Rhys Meyers (my favourite actor). I just decided, I would like to try myself in this this field as a screenwriter, and finally I came across a course from Paul Castro, a screenwriter of August Rush with Jonathan Rhys Meyers starring (who was my initial inspiration)!!! Of course, I enrolled without hesitation. \nMaybe a bit early for me as for a beginner, but Udemy offers a lifelong access, so I will definately return to the materials of the course  after I start writing. The material is very precious and helpful. Just what you need, very precise.\nThank you, Paul! I will definitely enroll for  other your courses!"

Not worth my money or time as I did not feel it gave me a fully loaded course with theory that would empower me to listen more than I do now. There were also too many quotes to fill up video time and too many times requesting comment/leave review. I would have been better off buying a book on active listening rather than doing this course even though I prefer going on courses to get certified. The instructor speaks clearly and the videos are also clear to watch on an iPad. Bottom line, disappointing."

I also happen to be the lucky one replacing a quite difficult team member who has been asked to leave before my arrival.  Listening to my colleagues say that upon my arrival there has been a new feeling, one of fresh air inside the office, something which was absent before. It's a great feeling to begin with."

Since then I have attuned myself to my ancestors and when I attended my first Pow Wow back in November 2014, I felt a calling to follow the path of shamanism and walk the good red road ever since. I\u2019ve been studying shamanism for some time but am very grateful to finally have been initiated. It is said that when the student is ready, the teacher will appear.
