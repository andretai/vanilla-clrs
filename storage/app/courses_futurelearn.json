The wider issues included climate change and greenhouse gases as well as ethical and sustainable food choices. It was a useful addition to four other FL food course I had participated in.  However, there were reasons for not giving the course 5 stars.  1] It needed proofreading; there were many errors, not just technical terms but also sentence structure and meaning. I, and several others, commented but there was no response.  2] The video voice-over appeared to be carried out by someone who did not know the subject and contained pronunciation errors in certain words rendering them meaningless. Both 1] and 2] were very distracting and may have caused for problems for people whose first language was not English.  3] Some articles were quite wordy; some parts could usefully have been turned into diagrams or other methods of presentation.  4] There was very little in the way of active mentoring as has been the case in some courses; this was a problem as 7 participants did nothing in their comments boxes except copy and paste a few words out of context, which meant that they were not engaging and only provided minimal, meaningless information. This is not the basis on which to have a discussion as I, and others, pointed out.  On the whole this has the potential to be a very good course, but it needs attention to detail and a few changes to make it up to the standard of some other food-related courses such as Understanding Food Labelling.

This was also reflected in the example of a property transaction, which for me was a good example of blending out reality by presenting a digital transaction: all parties to the transaction sitting virtually around the table and pushing buttons, one after the other, just 10 minutes! This was compared with the 2-3 months it takes to buy a property now. As mentioned, this purposely leaves out all the preparations that go into such a deal, from searching for a house, making an offer, principal agreement, contract, details of transfer, the surveyor, the Land Registry etc. In the UK some of these participants are required by law and in my own experience not always very professional or reliable. And yes, then the transfer of funds may still take a few days or weeks with the antiquated banking system. I think Block Chain does not need such constructed examples to show how good it is, it annoyed me because I had to go through this process in the UK twice, and can compare it with Switzerland where buying a property can be done in a week, with a 2 page contract compared with 80 pages in the UK.   I particularly liked the way the exercises encouraged searching for information, giving unexpected insight into the BC world and the many actors and activities.   On the certificate you mention 4 weeks 2 hours which I think is a bit mean. If you just listen, watch and read this is already tight, the exercises which are the main learning opportunities are ignored in this. Read LessRead less about review stating Blockchain"

My one criticism of the course was that using \"Atom\" for the IDE and command line for controlling the code development added complexity. I personally found it easier to use \"Idle\" as my IDE with Python 3 for my own work.
