The wider issues included climate change and greenhouse gases as well as ethical and sustainable food choices. It was a useful addition to four other FL food course I had participated in.  However, there were reasons for not giving the course 5 stars.  1] It needed proofreading; there were many errors, not just technical terms but also sentence structure and meaning. I, and several others, commented but there was no response.  2] The video voice-over appeared to be carried out by someone who did not know the subject and contained pronunciation errors in certain words rendering them meaningless. Both 1] and 2] were very distracting and may have caused for problems for people whose first language was not English.  3] Some articles were quite wordy; some parts could usefully have been turned into diagrams or other methods of presentation.  4] There was very little in the way of active mentoring as has been the case in some courses; this was a problem as 7 participants did nothing in their comments boxes except copy and paste a few words out of context, which meant that they were not engaging and only provided minimal, meaningless information. This is not the basis on which to have a discussion as I, and others, pointed out.  On the whole this has the potential to be a very good course, but it needs attention to detail and a few changes to make it up to the standard of some other food-related courses such as Understanding Food Labelling.
